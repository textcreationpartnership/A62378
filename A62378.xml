            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:105203:3"/>At length, I got the conqueſt over my dubious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, as not utterly deſpairing, but that, as with ſome gladſome embleme, it may return with an olive branch of good tidings, and acceptation in the Church of God: And ſurely, I knew not well, on what firmer ground to bottome thoſe hopes of mine, then on this, if it might but firſt ſet footing on that tree, which groweth upon your Mount; find acceſs and allowance at your <hi>Polti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> a place by far more fertile in celeſtiall graces, then ever Mount Olivet abounded in

            <p>And indeed, from whence, or whom, could I have found a more approved Patron of a ſcholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcourſe, (ſuch as this is) then ſo Honoured a Worthy as your ſelf; whoſe awfull power can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, and whoſe ſcientificall wiſdome can aright judg of it: I apprehend it not totally improbable, that the Author of this Book might be ſometime known to you by face, at leaſt upon report, or by his writings; but if not by the laſt, you may then poſſibly by this one ſingle grape, gueſſe at the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vintage of his other labours; the maturity of which in the proper ſeaſon, hath yielded <hi>(abſit ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo invidia,</hi>) the wholeſome liquor of ſoul-ſaving doctrine to Gods people: As to this particular Expoſition, I ſhall not ſpeake

<note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 5.3.</note> flat to the ground, diſhivered into duſt and aſhes: And as a meete preparatory thereto, the Text it ſelf is ſo artificially analyſed, the ſcope as if diſcovered by a ſun beame, cleared, the terms diſtinctly elucidated, and then the Doctrinall obſervations ſo genuinely deduced thence, as if this ſingle Commentary were the only key to unlock the more deep, and abſtruſe myſteries of the great <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> whoſe writings are in many things ſo

               </p>
               <p>The paſſage to <hi>Abraham's</hi> example, is by moſt conceived thus. The Apoſtle is imagined to prevent, what <hi>Iewes</hi> might object, againſt the concluſion of juſtification by faith, without works: If this be ſo, what got <hi>Abraham</hi> our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the fleſh? as if they had ſaid, it ſeems, there is no prerogative of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by all that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherein he lived: And the Apoſtle is ſuppoſed to grant their inference, and to ſubjoyn Reaſons thereof.</p>
               <p>But methinks, weighing the words, the connexion may rather be conceived, to be by way of inference, out of the doctrine of the former Chapter; as if it had been ſaid, if this be ſo, that boaſting muſt be excluded, and that all that are juſtified, muſt be juſtified by faith; What ſhall we ſay then, that <hi>Abraham</hi> our father found, as concerning the fleſh? &amp;c. In no caſe.</p>
               <p>Thus then, (but that I love not novelty,) I would read the text: <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that Abraham found by the fleſh?</hi> And ſo, methinks the reaſons more fluently are applyed to the Negative concluſion: The connexion we ſee.</p>
               <p>The concluſion principall is here proved, by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained not righteouſneſs by works, but by faith, then no man is, or can be juſtified by works, but by faith: but, <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by works, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man is juſtified by works. The propoſition is not expreſſed, but eaſily collected out of the text: The aſſumption is, Verſ 1. laid down in way of inference, delivered interrogatively, where the interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion implyes a negative: The concluſion is, Chap. 3. verſ. 28.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is proved, by an argument from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience: If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by works, he had whereof to boaſt, but not with God; that is, he had no cauſe to boaſt with God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was not juſtified by works.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>According to the fleſh</hi>] That is, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Ambroſius, ad loc.</note> by his Circumciſion; fittingly to what we may ſuppoſe the Apoſtle to preoccupate; and yet, in as much as ye count Circumciſion is a work; he affirms it as well of morall works, as of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>Say others, as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> by fleſh; that is,
<note place="margin">Cajetan, ad loc.</note> by righteouſneſs which ſtands in works, and are done by the fleſh, that is, by the body.</p>
               <p>Others as <hi>Theodoret</hi> by his own ſtrength,
<note place="margin">Theodoret ad loc. Illyric. in cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi &amp; Zanch. de tribus Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, lib. 3. cap. 1.</note> and good vvorks done thereby. Generally I thus conceive it, that <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained not righteouſneſs, by any work Ceremonicall, Morall, or whatſoever can be imagined, to aſſail to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, except faith in Chriſt; ſo finde I the uſe of the word, in the ſame caſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 9. Where, under this name of fleſh, comes circumciſion, our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is by the Law, or whatſoever is, or may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that righteouſneſs, which is by the faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The whole explination amounts to this ſumme; <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained not righteouſneſs, by any his own works.</p>
               <p>See we the confirmation: The argument is taken from an inconvenience, iſſuing out of that ſuppoſition; <hi>If Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory:</hi> But, he hath not any thing whereof to glory, at leaſt with God;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105203:11"/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was not juſtified by works.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee what our adverſaries have to ſay, againſt this full argument of the Apoſtle. For ground of their anſwer, they attempt an inverſion of the Apoſtles ſyllogiſme, and thus conceive him to reaſon:
<note place="margin">Sasbout, ad loc.</note> If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by works, then had he no glory, or boaſting with God; he might indeed by that means, procure the commendation of a man excellently righteous; but with men only, not with God: but <hi>Abraham</hi> had cauſe of glorying, and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting with God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> was not juſtified by works.</p>
               <p>This croſs frame of the argument,
<note place="margin">Auguſtin in prefat. ad Pſal. 31. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros. ad loc.</note> I could not without indignation read, were it not, that it hath great Authors to give it countenance; for Reverence to them, let us afford it tryall.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, conſider that the Apoſtle in this argument, hath apparent reſpect to that ground laid down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. That is, that we are to be juſtified by ſuch a mean, as whereby boaſting may be excluded; according to which ground he here concludes, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by works, for if that were true, then had he cauſe of boaſting. Is it not now too groſſe blindneſs, ſo to conceive the Apoſtle, as if he would give <hi>Abraham</hi> cauſe of boaſting?</p>
               <p>Secondly beſides this, the propoſition thus conceived, is apparently falſe: For, if <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtfied by works, then ſure he had cauſe of boaſting, even before God; for, what greater cauſe of glorying even before God, then this, That he hath wrought works to his juſtification, and may therefore ſay, he is not beholden to God, for his greateſt bleſſing, juſtification, as having purchaſed it by his own works of obedience, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.</p>
               <p>Thirdly add hereunto, that the aſſumption is apparently falſe; for <hi>Abraham,</hi> if the Apoſtle could judg, had no cauſe of boaſting with God; his juſtification being as ours, meerly of grace, through faith in Chriſt Jeſus: leave we therefore that dream, and ſee whether their other anſwers have more waight.</p>

               <p>Beſides this, according to this anſwer, boaſting is only in ſome part taken from <hi>Abraham;</hi> namely, in reſpect of his obſervance of Ceremonialls; for Morall obedience is ſtill left him, for matter of boaſting; but boaſting on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is excluded in <hi>Pauls intention; Ergo.</hi>

               <p>Hear <hi>Hierome; Ex operibus legis,

What Law I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if not that Morall?</p>
               <p>Let us ſee yet, whether other playſters will ſalve the ſore;
<note place="margin">Bellarm. qua ſupra.</note> works of <hi>Abraham</hi> are of two ſorts; ſome <hi>Praecedentia fidem,</hi> going before faith; ſome <hi>Facta per fidem,</hi> done by faith: the Apoſtle underſtands works done before faith and regeneration; not thoſe done in and by faith; Let us bring this into the argument: If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by works done without faith, by the meer power of natural free will, then had he cauſe of boaſting; not ſo, if by works
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105203:12"/>done in faith. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why not I marvail, when works done by grace, (according to their opinion) are done, partly, by ſtrength-naturall of free-will; ſo much then as free-will helped in the doing, ſo much cauſe of boaſting <hi>Abraham</hi> had of himſelf; But <hi>Abraham</hi> had no cauſe of boaſting, &amp;c. 2. What if it be apparent, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks even of works done by <hi>Abraham,</hi> now believing and regenerate; then methinks, theſe works muſt alſo be included, in the Apoſtles intention: Certainly if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the teſtimony alledged out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. in the next verſe, to prove, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by works, it will eaſily appear that <hi>Abraham</hi> was, long before this regenerate, and believing, and had many works of faith; whereas, yet the teſtimony of righteouſneſs is given him, not for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but for believing. It was a work of faith that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did, in following the Lords call out of his countrey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. Other works of piety and love, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.8. &amp; 13.8, 9. &amp; 14 16, 20, &amp;c. Yet not theſe works done in faith, but faith was imputed to righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>True ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, Abraham</hi> was now regenerate, and had done many good works of faith; and yet the Apoſtle, when he ſaith he was juſtified by faith and not by works, rejects not his works done in faith from power of juſtifing, but thoſe only which he (might) have done, not of faith: For even they who have faith, work ſometimes not of faith; as when they ſin, or do works meerly Morall, without relation to God: In a word, the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth conditionally, and according to their opinion, which aſcribed righteouſneſs to their own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now, what is to be willfully blind, if this be not? was it ever heard of, that a man ſhould be juſtified by works, not which he (had) done, but which he (might) have done: or, think we the Saints of God to whom he wrought, or the <hi>Iews</hi> that perhaps diſturbed them, were ever ſo ſhameleſs, as to aſcribe juſtice to works finfull, or meerly Morall, ſuch as heathens performed. Its apparent,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105203:12"/>that the Apoſtle fits anſwer to Iewiſh objections, who urged works of law, written for matter of juſtification: yea in likelihood, works done in grace, for whereto elſe comes in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo worthy a Saint of God? <hi>Certes,</hi> if of works meerly naturall, there had been queſtion, example of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> or <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> had been as pertinent to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly ſay others, the Apoſtle ſpeaks not <hi>de juſtificatione Pii,</hi> but <hi>Impii;</hi> not of that juſtification, whereby a man, of a righteous man is made more righteous; but he ſpeaks of juſtifiing a wicked man, which is done by faith: <hi>Anſw.</hi> Concerning this diſtinction, ſee Annotat. in Chap. 3.</p>
               <p>But it is their opinion, that he ſpeaks of the firſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation only: ſurely <hi>Sasbout</hi> confeſſeth, that the teſtimony out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> treats only, <hi>De augmento Iuſtitiae, &amp; non de juſtificatione Impii:</hi> And that is apparent to every confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reader.</p>
               <p>This miſt of cavills thus diſpelled, let us now reſume the Apoſtles concluſion, and lay it for a ground; that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by any works of any law, in any ſtate by him performed.</p>

                     <p>For what ſaith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs: Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt: but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>VVHether the words be conceived as proof of the Minor, or of the principall concluſion, it is not much materiall, the iſſue being all one: The argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, is taken from the manner, or meanes of <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification, which was meerly gracious; the Scripture affirms, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing, <hi>was counted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 15.6. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he had no cauſe of boaſting; becauſe, that not to the worker, but to the believer only, faith is imputed unto righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of this Enthymeme, hath its proof from the place of unlikes; That the force of the proofe may be better conceived, let us view a little the terms of the compariſon: The perſons compared are; he that worketh, and he that worketh not but believeth: The things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are compared as unlike, is the manner or means whereby theſe ſeverally obtain righteouſneſs: The worker that is, he that hath works to be juſtified by, he hath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs reckoned to him as wages; not granted out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but paid as of debt: He that hath no works but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, hath righteouſneſs counted to him, not of debt, but of favour; as if he had ſaid, that yee may ſee how <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> having faith counted righteouſneſs, left him no cauſe of boaſting; obſerve this difference, betwixt the worker, and believer, <hi>viz.</hi> He that hath works to bring before God, hath righteouſneſs aſcribed unto him of debt, not of grace; becauſe that by his works, he hath purchaſed righteouſneſs as wages, and ſo by conſequence hath cauſe of boaſting:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105203:13"/>him that juſtifieth the ungodly, its otherwiſe; this faith is of grace imputed to righteouſneſs; <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this latter ſort, not a worker, but a believer, and by conſequence, hath faith of grace counted to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; ſurely had no cauſe of boaſting, for this matter of juſtification: This, having the better judgment of the learned, I take to be the naturall reſolution of the text.</p>
               <p>Let us now turn back to the words, and enquire their ſenſe, and what inſtructions they afford for our uſe.</p>

Now, how much better were it that theſe men were dumb, then to uſe their tongues in manner ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly derogatory, to him that inſpires the Scripture: For, be it that in property of ſpeech the Scripture is ſpeechleſs, yet contains it not directions ſufficient to determine doubts? or needs it any more, then mans minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and his tongue to publiſh what it contains? Or, hath the Church any other authority about the Scripture, ſave only to declare what Gods Spirit therein ſpeaks?

               </p>

Secondly, The fruit, or benefit thereof; <hi>It was counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, <hi>Abrahams</hi> act, he believed God: Let us here a little largely, enquire what is the nature of juſtifying faith; ſo much the rather,
<note place="margin">The nature of juſtifying faith explained.</note> becauſe the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is famous, betwixt us and our adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Concerning it, two queſtions ſhall be handled:</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether it be an [aſſent] to the promiſe; Or, an [Affiance] rather, and truſting in the promiſe: Or, in plainer terms; whether this [to believe] in this queſtion, ſignifie, to give Credence to God ſpeaking; or elſe, to put confidence in God.</p>
               <p>The opinions both of them have great Authors, both Popiſh, and Proteſtant: For our better underſtanding, it ſhall not be amiſs to fetch the conſideration ſomewhat higher; even from the generall notion of theſe two habits, as they are conceived by Philoſophers and others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon.</p>
               <p>Faith therefore or beliefe, hath this generall deſcription: It is an habit of the underſtanding, inclining us to a firm, and undoubtfull aſſent to ſomething as truth, for the authority and credit of the ſpeaker, or witneſs. I call it firſt an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the underſtanding, becauſe, the proper object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is truth, and the act thereof an aſſent to truth; or, a perſwaſion and acknowledgment of the truth propounded: The difference ſtands, partly in the meaſure of aſſenting, partly in the cauſe moving to aſſent: for as touching abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute doubtfulneſs, when the minde hangs in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no aſſent either way, its quite oppoſite to the nature of faith.</p>
               <p>Now, the aſſent of the minde hath three degrees:</p>
               <p>The firſt is, when the minde hath ſome, though weak, inclination, and hath a propenſion to aſſent to a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, perhaps moved by ſome ſlight ſign, or by appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of poſſible truth; ſome call this ſuſpition, more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps, conjecture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105203:15"/>
The Second is, when the aſſent is more ſtable, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; yet not without fear, that the contrary may be true: this called opinion.</p>
               <p>The Third and higheſt, is a perfect and peremptory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that the thing propounded is of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and certain truth; of this laſt ſort, is the aſſent that faith yields.</p>
               <p>Now, this certain and perfect aſſent is of four ſorts, according to a fourfold means ſwaying the minde: The firſt is, that which is cauſed by ſenſe; as when the minde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a thing for truth, becauſe it hath received per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intelligence from the ſight, hearing, &amp;c. or, other ſenſes not hindered or deceived: The ſecond is, that which is cauſed out of the clear light and evidence of the thing, without arguments of any kinde to perſwade it; as in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples clear of themſelves, and that need no demonſtration or evidence, but their own light to convince; as that, <hi>omne totum majus eſt ſuâ parte:</hi> The third is, that which is cauſed by certain diſcourſe, and demonſtrative arguments, which they call ſcience: The laſt is, that which is procured by the authority and credit of him, that propounds a thing to be received for truth; which authority (being without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) breeds perſwaſion as firm, as any can be raiſed by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſenſe, or if there be any other means more forcible with the minde to perſwade: And of this laſt ſort is faith.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Fiducia,</hi> confidence or affiance, is that habit, or act of the will, whereby we hopefully repoſe our ſelves upon the power, truth, and goodneſs of the promiſer, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſome good thing promiſed.</p>
               <p>It differs from belief. 1. In the proper ſeat; belief being in the underſtanding, affiance in the will. 2. In the object which its carried unto, which is <hi>bonum,</hi> not <hi>verum.</hi> 3. As the effect from the cauſe; this repoſing of our ſelves on, ariſing from a perſwaſion of the power, truth, goodneſs of him we truſt in: And of the general notion of theſe two qualities thus far.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105203:15"/>
Their difference we ſhall better yet ſee, if we conſider the divers phraſes of ſpeech, wherein the Scripture expreſſeth their actions, fittingly to that uſuall diſtinction received from <hi>Auſtin,</hi> putting difference betwixt theſe two acts of;
<note place="margin">S. Aug. Trict. in Ioh. 29. and Serm. 61, de verb. Domini.</note> 
                  <hi>Credere deo, &amp; Credere in deum:</hi> The firſt being the act of beliefe, properly ſo called; the other expreſſing the act of that other habit which we call <hi>fiduciam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To apply this <hi>Praemiſſa</hi> to the purpoſe; the queſtion is, of whether ſort that faith which we call juſtifying is; whether a giving credit to God promiſing us remiſſion of ſins in Chriſt; or a relying on his mercy, and the merits of Chriſt, for pardon of ſins and life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>The ſeverall opinions ſhall be propounded and examined, that the truth may the better appear.</p>
               <p>Papiſts, well nigh all that I have ſeen, Reſolve of the former, and thus determine;
<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap, 5. &amp; 9. See Kemnit. Exam. lib. 1. cap. de Fide juſtific.</note> That Faith juſtifying is no ſuch Affiance, or Confidence in Gods mercy, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants teach; but a general aſſent to all things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Word of God, and a perſwaſion of their Truth.</p>
               <p>Of our own Divines, ſome not of loweſt rank, judg, that it is meerly an aſſent to the truth of the Goſpell, or Evangelicall promiſe made to us in Chriſt, And they would thus be underſtood; not that it excludes beliefe of the reſt of Gods word, but that (as it juſtifies,) it reſpects only the Goſpel: And further, this aſſent they make of two ſorts; one generall, whereby we believe the Goſpel to be true; another ſpeciall, whereby we believe it to be true to (us.)</p>
               <p>A third ſort there are, that make it meerly an affiance or confidence in God, and his Chriſt for pardon of ſins, and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The laſt is of them, that make it partly an aſſent particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, partly affiance; of theſe, let us enquire which comes neareſt unto the truth.</p>
               <p>As touching that of Papiſts, making it only a generall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105203:16"/>aſſent to the truth of the whole word of God, without any particularlizing either of the object, or of the aſſent:</p>
               <p>The reaſons are forcible againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that by this means, juſtification is extended to ſundry reprobates, yea, after a ſort, to divells; for if this be the faith that juſtifyeth, namely, whereby men aſſent to the truth of the word of God;
<note place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> then muſt all in whom ſuch faith is, be partakers of juſtification: but only the
<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate are juſtified; reprobates and divells not ſo; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Our next reaſon is, from the effects of faith juſtifying; one ſpeciall whereof is, that it makes our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice all
<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> acceptable to God, through Ieſus Chriſt: Now, how a generall aſſent to the truth of Gods word, without a particular perſwaſion of his love to us in Chriſt, ſhould thus ſweeten our ſervices; I would have them explain, ſith none pleaſeth,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.19.</note> but what iſſues from love of God; and that again flowes from our perſwaſion of Gods love to us in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Add unto this, thoſe other gracious effects or faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; as, that it breeds peace of conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, yea joy in afflictions, under hope certain of glory;</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of appearing before God in prayers, &amp;c. yea in the day of judgment: Can theſe be imagined to flow from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall faith? Theſe, and many the like reaſons, ſufficiently overthrow that dream of generall faith.</p>
               <p>Let us examine theſe Reaſons; the ſumme of them I will briefly propound.</p>
               <p>The Firſt lyes thus; the faith deſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. is not a ſpeciall perſwaſion of Gods ſpeciall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or an affiance therein; but only a generall aſſent, to the truth of the whole word of God. But the faith there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed is juſtifying faith: <hi>Ergò,</hi> Juſtifying faith is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Gods ſpeciall mercie, or a confidence therein but a general aſſent to the truth of the whole word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the minor I thus anſwer; that its eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the Apoſtle in that whole Chapter, deſcribes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105203:16"/>that faith that juſtifies: But, whether he intend an exact definition of the nature of it, (as it juſtifieth) or rather a ſetting out, and commendation thereof, by the effects and properties, is the queſtion: And its apparent, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles purpoſe, is not ſo much to give us an exact definition of the nature of it; as to exhort to continue therein, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from the properties, and wonderfull effects that were wrought by it in the Saints that have gone before us, as appears there; and in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. and 12.1.2. For, firſt, think we the Apoſtle ſo ill an Artiſt, as to compoſe his definition of Terms amoſt all figurative as, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired exactly to ſet down the nature of it to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Beſides, that ſome of the effects aſcribed there to faith, are particular, and almoſt perſonally belonging to the Saints there mentioned, and which we cannot but fooliſhly expect to be wrought by our faith: Now had the Apoſtle there intended to deſcribe that faith that juſtifieth, ſo as to ſhew us the nature thereof, (as it juſtifieth) impertinently, had thoſe works as miraculous, and of perſonall obedience been there inſerted.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Major,</hi> it is denied: Even the faith there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, is a ſpeciall perſwaſion of Gods ſpeciall mercy, and an affiance therein: For what though there be no mention made of any ſuch ſpecialty, either of the perſwaſion or of the object, or of the affiance; cannot it therefore be ſuch, becauſe its there deſcribed by effects and properties? The Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, deſcribes unto us at large true Chriſtian charity, by Neceſsity, Effects, perpetuall endurance: ſhall we now ſay, that Charity is no benevolous, or wel-wiſhing affection towards our neighbour; becauſe there is no expreſs mention made thereof, where it is purpoſely deſcribed? Adde unto this, That this ſpeciall perſwaſion of Gods love in Chriſt, and affiance in his mercy, is there neceſſarily inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; it being impoſſible, that any of theſe works of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could have been, either ſo couragiouſly undertaken, or ſo acceptably performed, had they not had even ſuch faith as we now enquire of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:105203:17"/>
Their ſecond reaſon lies thus: The faith which Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, commended, exhorted unto, approved with mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, was onely a generall aſſent to the truth of the word of God; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. and 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that faith which Chriſt ſo required and commended, &amp;c. was faith juſtifying; <hi>Ergò,</hi> Juſtifying faith is onely a generall aſſent to the truth of the word of God; or, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf inferrs the concluſion,
<note place="margin">Kemnit. qua ſuprà.</note> it hath for the object ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe beſides Gods ſpeciall Mercy. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If that be the concluſion, it was never denied by our Divines, but that the faith that juſtifieth, hath for the object, not ſpeciall mercy onely, but the whole word of God: If that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the concluſion, the Adverſary proves what is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: For we grant (if they will needs have it) that its the ſame faith which believes both the Hiſtory in generall, and which receives, and reſts on the ſpeciall mercie of God for juſtification.</p>
               <p>But the queſtions be, 1. Whether generall faith alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to juſtification? 2. Whether the object of faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying (as it is juſtifying) be the promiſes of the Goſpel, as they concern us? The firſt of theſe we deny; the ſecond we avow, and prove, <hi>ut ſuprà:</hi> there is none of us, that ever denied, but that its the ſame faith, which aſſents to the truth of the word of God, in generall, and which juſtifieth us in the ſight of God: But if we ſpeak of faith (as its juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſo we ſay, it reſpects particularly the promiſe of the Goſpel. I illuſtrate what I mean by this ſimilitude: Its the ſame ſoul, whereby a man lives, moves, exerciſeth ſenſe, and uſeth reaſon; but yet, if the queſtion be, What it is in the ſoul that forms a man to his particular nature: We ſay, its the ſoul, not as it gives life, motion or ſenſe; but as it uſeth reaſon: Even ſo, &amp;c. Now to the proofs of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part, I anſwer that the <hi>Major</hi> is untrue; The faith which Chriſt required, was not onely, a generall aſſent to the truth of the word of God, concerning his perſon, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, offices &amp;c. but principally, it was particular aſſent, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105203:17"/>affiance alſo in him, as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed: as by view of ſome of the principall obligations will appear: For, think we the acknowledgment of this propoſition in generall; <hi>[That Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God]</hi> is that,
<note place="margin">See Joh. 20. and 1 Ioh. 5.</note> that juſtifieth and ſaveth: Then how fail Divells of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? yea, and of eternall life, that ſenſibly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>him to be Jeſus, the Son of the living God,</hi> Mark 2. Beſides, what means our Saviour ſo often to invite us unto him; and propounding the condition of eternall life, to utter it in a phraſe importing affiance? as, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.40. yea, particular acknowledgment of him to be a Saviour unto us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Thus I reaſon, A <hi>Pari;</hi> other parts and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Scripture propounded generally are to be believed, not only as they concern the generall, but particularly as having their truth in us: Why not then, theſe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound remiſſion of ſins, righteouſneſs and ſalvation, to be obtained by Chriſt? For inſtance, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, that every one is accurſed that keeps not the Law; <hi>that the wages of ſin is death.</hi> &amp;c. Binds it not me alſo to believe, that I alſo for (my) ſins, am by nature ſubject to the curſe? that the proper wages for (my) ſins, is death. When it propounds promiſes of temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as it doth to them that ſeeks Gods Kingdome, and his righteouſneſs: ought not I to acknowledg this promiſe to belong to (me,) and to place confidence in God for the performance? Why then, when the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins is made to believers, binds it no (me,) and every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, to aſſume that (my) ſins are pardoned? when it teacheth Chriſt to be the Saviour of the world, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Righteouſneſs to thoſe that obey him; ſhould I not ſay, that Chriſt requiring generall faith, intends alſo a particular applying of this generall to my ſelf, for my comfort and ſalvation? More I add not in this kinde.</p>
               <p>Two paradoxes only of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. l. 1. de juſtific. cap. 8.</note> I will briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and ſo leave them:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105203:18"/>
The firſt is, that faith is juſtifying, though it have no reſpect to Gods ſpeciall mercy.</p>
               <p>The Second, That it is not juſtifying, if perhaps it have reſpect thereto.</p>
               <p>The proofes have in them the quinteſſence of <hi>Ieſuitical acumen:</hi> The Leprous mans faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. was a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith; and yet had no reſpect to ſpeciall mercy. <hi>Ergò,</hi> Faith not reſpecting ſpeciall mercy is juſtifying. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The propoſition needs proof; inasmuch as many had faith for obtaining Miracles, that had none at all, touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Meſſiah, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 2. How proves he, that he had no ſpeciall faith, concerning remiſſion of ſins by Chriſt? What, becauſe he doubts of his will, for his cure! As who ſay, there may not be ſpeciall faith, touching par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins, even where there is doubt of obtaining ſome remporall bleſſing: the one having a promiſe for Gods children to reſt on; the other not ſo, but with limitation to expediency.</p>
               <p>But will you ſee how he proves, that faith is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, if it have reſpect to ſpeciall mercy: The <hi>Phariſee</hi> having it, even becauſe he had it, was not juſtified? <hi>Ergò, Anſw.</hi> And, was the <hi>Phariſees</hi> affiance in Gods ſpeciall mercy, the Reaſon, why he was not juſtified? Nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vain boaſting of his own righteouſneſs; as appears by the drift of the parable expreſſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.9. <hi>Vacuus proindè rediit,
<note place="margin">Bernard. de Annuc. Ser. 3. ad calcem.</note> quia plenitudinem ſimulavit,</hi> as S. <hi>Bernard:</hi> and therefore failed he of juſtification; not becauſe he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Gods ſpeciall mercy to obtain it, but for that he truſted in himſelf that he had it.</p>
               <p>Some Ancients let us hear in this point,
<note place="margin">Bernard de Annuc. Serm. 1.</note> ſaith <hi>Bernard: Si credis pecoata tua non poſſe deleri, niſi ab eo cui ſoli pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câſti, &amp; in quem peccatum non cadit, benè facis: Sed adde adhuc, ut &amp; hoc credas, quia per ipſum (Tibi) peccata donan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; hoc eſt, Teſtimonium, quod perhibit in corde noſtro ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſanctus, dicens; dimiſſa ſunt tibi Poccata Tua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second opinion, touching the nature of ſaith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105203:18"/>(as it is juſtifying) is this, that juſtifying faith is an aſſent not ſo much to the truth of the whole word of God, as to the promiſes of the Goſpell, and that, as having their truth in (us.) The difference betwixt this and the Popiſh opinion, ſtands in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt in the object, which they make the whole word of God; theſe only the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the manner of aſſenting, which they make generall, without any particular applying to our ſelves theſe particulars: They conſent in this, that it is an act of the underſtanding, rather then of the will; perſwaſion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then conſidence; aſſent, rather then affiance: And for this they have theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that the faith that juſtifieth, is ſo often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a phraſe importing aſſent, or giving credit, as in this Scripture; <hi>Abraham believed God;</hi> that is, gave cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to God promiſing to be his reward, &amp;c. <hi>Similia vide,</hi> Mark 1.15.</p>
               <p>Their Second Reaſon is, becauſe the object thereof, is uſually made the propoſitions of the Goſpel, and that which they call <hi>Terminum complexum;</hi> or, as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaks, ſomething propounded; <hi>per modum enuntiabilis:</hi> or, to ſpeak more plainly, and agreeably to the phraſe of Scripture; a teſtimony which God gives in the word, and in the heart; See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16 <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>A Third Reaſon, Becauſe it ſeems ſtrange, that faith juſtifying ſhould have divers ſeats, or ſubjects; The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as an aſſent; the will as an affiance: From hence and the like reaſons, it is concluded, that faith juſtifying is an aſſent, rather then affiance.</p>
               <p>Now, that it hath not for the proper object, the whole word of God; but rather, only the doctrine of the goſpel, (as it is juſtifying) theſe Reaſons evince.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that our Saviour preſcribing the act, limits out alſo the object, and makes it the Goſpel, rather then any other part of the Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105203:19"/>
Secondly,
<note place="margin">Kemn it. in Exam. part 1. de Fide juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic.</note> For that in other parts of the word of God; faith findes not what it may lay hold on, for reconciliation, remiſſion of ſins, and juſtification but only in the Goſpel; that is, the word of reconciliation; there is Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour propounded, there remiſſion of ſins promiſed.</p>
               <p>For the Third branch, that its a particular aſſent; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I mean, not only in reſpect of the Subject, but of the Object, Examples prove, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Chriſt loved (me,) gave himſelf for (me:)</hi> The generalls of the Goſpel thus particularized, are that which faith juſtifying (as it is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying) reſpects; by this faith <hi>Paul</hi> lived.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In point of believing, there can elſe be no difference betwixt faith of Reprobates and that of the Elect; betwixt faith of Divells, and of juſtified men: For, its an idle tenant of theirs, that they make charity the form of faith; a gift diſparate from it not in act and office only, but in the very ſubject and ſeat where it reſides: More ſee to this purpoſe, <hi>Suprà.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third opinion is of them, that make it only an affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reſting on God, and his Chriſt, as propounded in the goſpel for juſtification, and remiſsion of ſins. And for this opinion theſe Reaſons are brought.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that the phraſe wherein uſually it is expreſſed, imports rather confidence and affiance, then aſſent or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp; alibi:</hi> But finde we it not, as often expreſſed in a phraſe, that ſignifies aſſenting?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe, they cannot elſe finde a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt faith juſtifying, and that which may be in hypocrites and divells: What ſay they to that particularity of aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and appropriating the generals to our ſelves; a thing as impoſſible for hypocrites or divels to perform, as that other of affiance; and what to that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. that makes this confidence a fruit of faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
               <p>The laſt tenant is of thoſe, that make it partly an aſſent particular; partly an affiance; and, for that opinion are theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:105203:19"/>
Firſt, For that the phraſes of ſpeech wherein it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſeem to import both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are both required as neceſſary to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not only as diſpoſitions, but after a ſort as ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; not only as qualifications of the perſon, but our means of juſtifications.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe they concur in every perſon juſtified, as he is juſtified.</p>
               <p>Now, Of theſe three laſt, which is the truth, I dare not peremptorily determine: For my part, I profeſs my ſelf to think with them, that make faith juſtifying and aſſent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then affiance; eſpecially for that place <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. Howbeit, I may not deny but that the affiance ſpoken of, in an inſeparable companion of that aſſent; perhaps alſo, as conferring ſomething to juſtification: yet this I am well aſſured of. Firſt, Faith properly ſo called, hath its ſeat in the underſtanding. Secondly, According to Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, imports a perſwaſion. Thirdly, In uſe of Scripture, moſt frequently ſignifieth giving credit, rather then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting confidence. Fourthly, And, if there be any truth in that our Divines affirm, concerning the office of faith, [in applying Chriſt to our ſelves,] moſt likely it ſhould be an aſſent, rather then affiance; applying or appropriating of Chriſt to us, being no more but this; an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Chriſt is ſuch to us, as the Scripture deſcribes him, a Redeemer, a Saviour, a Mediatour of reconcilement, and Author of righteouineſs and ſalvation; which acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an act of the underſtanding, not of the will. Fiftly Beſides this, the oppoſites or defects of faith, are apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the underſtanding, and import defect of aſſenting, as doubting. Sixtly, The perfection and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as I may term it) of this grace, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, fulneſs of aſſent and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the grace it ſelf for ſubſtance, therefore, is of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Let us view a little how the Apoſtle in this Chapter, expreſſeth that faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which <hi>to him was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105203:20"/>to righteouſneſs:</hi> In this verſe its thus enunciated, <hi>Abraham believed God;</hi> that is, gave credit and aſſent, to what the Lord promiſed touching a ſeed; and verſ. 22. He was fully aſſured, or perſwaded, that he which had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, was able to perform: and this perſwaſion <hi>was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for righteouſneſs:</hi> All which laid together ſway my judgment to theirs, that teach faith juſtifying to be ſuch an aſſent, as in the third opinion is expreſſed, rather then affiance; and of the nature of faith juſtifying, thus far. There remains yet one thing, before we proceed to the fruit of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, expreſſed in the next member: And that is, to enquire how fitly this teſtimony is alledged, to the purpoſe of juſtification; the promiſe being in ſhew only of a temporall bleſſing; namely, a numerous ſeed, and no mention made of Chriſt the Mediator, whom faith juſtifing (as it is ſuch) reſpects. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Anſwers here are diverſly conceived; the likelieſt I will propound.</p>
               <p>Firſt Its thus anſwered, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith whereby he believed the promiſes, both touching the reward, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and touching the ſeed, cannot be imagined to have been, without reſpect to Chriſt the Mediator; inasmuch as <hi>all the the promiſes of God, are yea, and Amen</hi> in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. That is, have their accompliſhment and ratification in, and for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the ſeed mentioned in the promiſe, is rather to be underſtood of the ſpirituall ſeed, then of the carnall poſterity of <hi>Adam; and the head thereof is Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle interprets, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>The fruit of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith follows: <hi>[It was counted to him for righteouſneſs.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference in the reading out of the Hebrew origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, is little or nothing: Hebrew thus; he imputed, or <hi>counted it for righteouſneſs:</hi> out of the ſeptuagint, its ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poſitively, <hi>it was counted for righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſenſe of the words, if it be enquired, What was it, that was counted righteouſneſs? Its anſwered, faith;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105203:20"/>as appears both by the text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. as alſo, verſ. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was counted unto him for righteouſneſs</hi>] For better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the text, let us conſider the word; firſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and alone, according to the native ſignification, and uſe of Scripture. 2. Conjunctly, according as thereof ſundry phraſes are raiſed,</p>
               <p>The word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignifies uſually two things: Firſt, To repute or eſteem, and make reckoning of. Secondly to impute or aſcribe: In the firſt ſenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>What is man, that thou reputeſt, or eſteemeſt him?</hi> Chriſt was reckoned amongſt the wicked; that is, eſteemed as they, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.12. In the ſecond ſenſe, the uſe is alſo frequent; <hi>Philem.</hi> verſ. 18. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth the ought; impute, that is, aſcribe it to mee, and ſet it as it were upon my ſcore: the ſpeech being borrowed from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
               <p>The phraſes of ſpeech, ariſing from conjunction of this word with others, are divers in Scripture.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter, <hi>faith is ſaid to be imputed to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or, <hi>reckoned for righteouſneſs;</hi> wages is ſaid to be reckoned, or imputed; righteouſneſs to be imputed to a man; ſins to be imputed, or not imputed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter.</p>
               <p>The Firſt phraſe is, of all the reſt, of moſt difficult expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Conjectures of others, that have any probability, I will propound: ſome thus; Faith was (counted) for righteouſneſs; that is, inſtead of righteouſneſs; as if it ſupplyed the ſtead of the righteouſneſs of the Law, in this point of juſtification: and this expoſition they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, by likeneſs of phraſe in other things, as they conceive it; As <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. Uncircumciſion is (counted) for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that is, inſtead of circumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. The Children of the promiſe are (counted) for the ſeed, that is, inſtead of the ſeed: But, why not thus rather? they are (counted) the ſeed: for ſo they are apparently, not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned iuſtead of the ſeed, but counted or eſteemed the leed;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105203:21"/>they being the ſeed, with which the Covenant is made.</p>
               <p>Others thus; Faith is (imputed) to righteouſneſs; that is, aſcribed unto them, and taken notice of ſo far, as that he was for it (eſteemed) righteous: We ſhall beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning, by comparing the ſelf-ſame phraſe as it it is extant <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.31. <hi>Phineas</hi> his executing judgment, was (counted) to him for righteouſneſs, to all generations for evermore; that is, he for that fact, or, by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had the (eſteem) of a righteous man amongſt men, unto all poſterity: So, <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was (counted) to him for righteouſneſs before God; that is, he for believing; or, by means of faith, was eſteemed or reckoned righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God: This, as far as I conceive, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaning of the phraſe.</p>
               <p>If that hypallage ſeem harſh, thus conceive it: His belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving was reckoned unto him to righteouſneſs; that is, came into reckoning ſo far with God on his behalf; or, for his benefit, that thereby he obtained righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Faith then is of that reckoning with God, as that to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yea to every man endued thrrewith, he allowes the eſteem of a righteous man; underſtand faith as its before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this concluſion; let us ſee a little, how faith obtains this bleſſing of righteouſneſs at Gods hands; or, what is the reaſon of the connexion of righteouſneſs with believing?
<note place="margin">Bellarm. de juſt if. lib. 1. cap. 17.</note> Divers are the explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Papiſts impute it, ſometimes, to the merit and worth of the very habit or act of faith; as if it deſerved at Gods hands juſtification, and had the force of a proper efficient cauſe meritoriouſly to procure it: Againſt it are theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Bernard Ser. 1. de Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat.</note> Hereof we may ſay, as <hi>Bernard</hi> of other good works; or, as he terms them, merits, that its not ſuch, as as that (for it) righteouſneſs ſhould be due to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of right; or, as though God ſhould do us wrong, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he gave to us believing righteouſneſs; for this, as all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105203:21"/>other good qualities, or actions, is the gift of God; and therefore man is rather a debtor to God for it, then God to man.</p>
               <p>Secondly Beſides this, how holds the difference aſſigned by the Apoſtle, betwixt the worker, and the believer, in the manner of obtaining righteouſneſs, if righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the believer as a reward of debt?</p>
               <p>If righteouſneſs belong to the believer, of debt, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of believing, then, vainly doth the Apoſtle alledg this as a difference, betwixt the believer, and the worker; that the one hath righteouſneſs paid as of debt, the other given as of grace: but, the difference is ſure authenticall. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Their arguments will be fitlyeſt anſwered, when we come to ſet down the opinions of our own Divines.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they thus conceive it that faith is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">Bellarm. <hi>qua ſupra.</hi>
                  </note> and the inchoate formall cauſe of righteouſneſs; that is, part of that righteouſneſs, whereby we are made formally righteous: and that they would prove out of this text; becauſe to him that believeth in him that juſtifyeth the ungodly, his faith is counted to righteouſneſs: But, they would deceive us with a falſe gloſſe; for, that is not the meaning that faith is (counted) our righteouſneſs; but that its taken notice of ſo far as that to the believer righteouſneſs is imputed. A (mean) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of obtaining righteouſneſs, not righteouſneſs it ſelf; except by righteouſneſs, they will underſtand that of ſanctification 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. Wherefore we acknowledg it to be a part: but, what is that to the righteouſneſs of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whereof the queſtion is? 2. After their own gloſſe, its righteouſneſs only <hi>aeſtimativè,</hi> not therefore formally.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again, they make righteouſneſs depend on faith, as a preparation thereto in part, neceſſary to diſpoſe the ſubject to receive juſtification; that is, as they term it, the infuſion of charity and other graces, whereby we are made formally righteous: <hi>Verſipelles!</hi> Where may we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105203:22"/>finde you? Is it the form of righteouſneſs, and yet but a preparation to righteouſneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> The form inchoate, not compleat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I demand; Is it before the other graces of God in time? Or, are they togethes with it infuſed? If ſo, how then make you yet a preparation only to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; when as together with it, other gifts which make up righteouſneſs compleate, are infuſed? Let us leave them, and come to explications of our own Divines.</p>
               <p>Some thus, Righteouſneſs or juſtification, hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with faith, by an order that God hath been pleaſed to ſet down, in the Covenant of grace; which is this, that whoſoever ſhall believe in Chriſt, ſhall be juſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This condition now performed on our parts, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ours; and we are as righteous in Gods eſteem, as if we had all the righteouſneſs of the Law performed by our ſelves: Now, this is an evident and clear truth, that, in the Evangelical Covenant, faith is the condition of juſtification: But firſt, if faith juſtifies us, as a condition performed by us; fain I would know, how we may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that doctrine of our Churches, concerning ſole faith, and its being the only thing in us, that avails to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of juſtification: for, if we view the tenour of the Covenant of grace, faith is not the only condition requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us to juſtification, and remiſſion of ſins; for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance alſo is a condition required, in that covenant to the ſame end, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Repent, and believe the Goſpel;</hi> Act. 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized, for remiſsion of ſins;</hi> but, faith muſt ſo juſtifie, that (in that work) no other thing may ſhare with it, no not repentance it ſelf. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Beſides this, if the act of faith <hi>(qua actus)</hi> be that for which we are juſtified; how doth the Apoſtle deſcribe our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be without works? <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. How ſets he the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and believer in direct oppoſition, in the articles of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? Perhaps, it will be ſaid, that works of the law only are excluded, not this, which is a worker of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105203:22"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſhould ſeem, that not only works of the law, but univerſally all works are excluded; becauſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may occaſion boaſting in man, is exclnded <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Now, as great occaſion of boaſting is left to man in the act of faith, as in any work of the law whatſoever: Nay, may ſome manſay, for faith is the gift of God, and the exerciſe of faith meerly his work. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame may as truly be ſaid of love, patience, &amp;c. Theſe being alſo gifts infuſed of God, and their actions, even every act of them, meerly his works in us, even as meerly as the act of faith.</p>
               <p>It remains then, that we enquire, whether in the other explanations of our Divines, more likelihood may be found.</p>
               <p>Uſully, its thus conceived to juſtifie; namely as it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to apprehend that righteouſneſs for which we are juſtified, even the
<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note> righteouſneſs of Chriſt; whether of this life, or death, or both, it is not pertinent to this place to enquire; but in this reſpect, righteouſneſs is aſcribed unto it.</p>
               <p>And here we are asked, whether we finde faith to have any ſuch act, or office, as to apprehend and receive Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Amongſt other places that is pregnant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17.

After this ſentence, we ſee how faith alone juſtifieth, namely, becauſe faith only hath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive the gift of righteouſneſs: This laid alſo for a ground, boaſting is excluded in every reſpect; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all other explanations, is left in ſome reſpect unto men.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo is the comfort of conſcience left provided for, when Gods children ſhall be taught, out of the word of God, that the righteouſneſs whereby they are juſtified
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105203:23"/>before God, is ſo abſolute, and every way perfect, as is that of Chriſt; and that it ſufficeth them to juſtification, that they [receive] it, whether by ſtrong, or weak Faith; the virtue of Righteouſneſs being ſtil the ſame, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in what meaſure ſoever it be received. As, the alms given is of the ſame benefit, whether the hand that receives it be ſteady, or ſhaking, ſo it be received.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of all is this; ſith Faith is accepted to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, neither, in reſpect of the [Worth] of it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; nor yet, as being the [Form] of righteouſneſs; nor, as a [Preparation;] nor, as a [Condition:] It remains, that it juſtifieth [Inſtrumentally] onely; or, becauſe, it [apprehends] that, [for] which we are juſtified, namely, the merit, and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For Uſe of this point, let it be this: It affords Comfort to every weary ſoul, groaning under the burthen of ſinne, and preſſed with the Terrours of the Almighty, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the Curſe of the Law due to Tranſgreſſions: If thou believe in the Lord Jeſus, and haſt received this grace, by faith to receive his righteouſneſs offered in the Goſpel, thy ſins are forgiven, and ſhall never be imputed to Condemnation; Thou ſtandeſt as juſt, in Gods ſight, as if thou hadſt, in thine own perſon, performed exactly the whole obedience, that the Law requires. And, let no man ſay, it is true, if they could (firmly) believe, as Abraham; but, their faith is ſo weak, and wavering, that even, for it, Condemnation is due them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For this, Conſider, that it is not the ſtrength of Faith that juſtifies; not Faith, as an Act, wherein our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſtands: but it is that, which Faith apprehends, that juſtifies, even the obedience, and righteouſneſs of Chriſt: That apprehended truly, in what meaſure ſoever, covers all defects, not onely of Legall obedience, but even of Faith it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing here obſervable, is this; That whereas to Abraham, that had now, long time, been Regenerate, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105203:23"/>in ſtate of grace, had done many works of Piety, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; Yet Faith is ſtill counted to Righteouſneſs: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows well, that [whole] juſtification is abſolved in Faith; and that Faith is not onely the beginning of Righteouſneſs, but the very complement thereof.</p>
               <p>And,
<note place="margin">Bellarm. qua ſupra.</note> it is to be obſerved againſt that errour of Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, that, to evade the direct teſtimonies of Scripture, againſt <hi>Juſtification by works,</hi> and for that by <hi>Faith alone;</hi> have deviſed a diſtinction of <hi>Juſtification:</hi> It is, ſay they,

               <p>Now, To omit, that, in this Doctrine, they confound things to be diſtinguiſhed, namely, <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> There is no ground for this diſtinction of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scriptures; nay, grounds many againſt it.</p>

               <p>Let us, for the purpoſe, imagine the Lord, the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributor of reward, according to the double covenant of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105203:24"/>works, and grace, to have referred all men to two ranks, <hi>viz.</hi> Workers and Believers; to reſolve with himſelf, to crown both with a ſentence of righteouſneſs, according as they bring to him, either works ſuch as the Law preſcribes; or, faith in Chriſt.

                  </label> The things out of this paſſage of Scripture obſervable,
are theſe: Firſt, the direct oppoſition of Faith and Works, in this Article of juſtification; If it be by Faith, its not of Works; If by Works, not of Faith; that howſoever it be true, their concurrence is certain, their agreement amiable in the life of the juſtified; yet their contrariety irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the procurement of juſtification.</p>
               <p>Not to be long in the manifeſtation of it; Firſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles argument hath elſe no force in the caſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> except their oppoſition be ſuch as is mentioned. 2. Beſides this, view it in the contrary principles, from which the two kinds of juſtification proceed: The Worker is juſtified of debt; the believer, of grace; that look what oppoſition there is betwixt favour and debt; the ſame is betwixt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works, and juſtification by Faith; Like ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.</p>
               <p>Now, were it not a point of acute Sophiſtry, to teach us how to deny the Apoſtles argument, and to tell him the conſequence is not good, becauſe they are able to aſſigne a <hi>medium?</hi> Witty, I confeſſe, but with ſuch wit, as S. <hi>James</hi> tells us to be
<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>deviliſh.</hi> Such as it is let us hear it, forſooth, they point us to this <hi>medium</hi> of participation; It is partly by Faith, partly by Works: I ſay not any man is ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as in plain terms to contradict the Apoſtle, but ſurely this in the iſſue ſhall be found their anſwer, howſoever with diſtinctions they colour the matter. Let us hear them;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105203:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>Juſtification by Faith, and juſtification by Works, indeed are oppoſite, if ye underſtand in both the ſame juſtification; but there is a firſt juſtification, and a ſecond; the one is by Faith, the other by Works. Again, works are of two ſorts; works of Nature, works of Grace: betwixt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by works of Nature, and that by Faith, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an oppoſition; not ſo in that by works of Grace: For theſe diſtinctions, and the vanity of them, ſee <hi>ſuprà ad ver.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; Annotat. ad cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>This once is evident out of this place, that the Apoſtle imputes the juſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> now regenerate unto his Faith; and betwixt the juſtification that <hi>Abraham</hi> had being now in grace, and that of works placeth the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides this, what means the Apoſtle to befool the <hi>Galatians,</hi> for expecting the perfection of this benefit by the Law, which was begun by the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. Would he not thereby teach us, that whole juſtification is perfected in Faith? And for works of grace, though (as hath been ſaid) they agree with faith well in the heart of a Chriſtian; yet juſtification, even by theſe works, is oppoſite to that of Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. More I adde not; onely I adviſe them that labour to mingle <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Faith and Works, in this point of juſtification, to remember what <hi>Paul</hi> hath pronounced, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. with a ſolemn proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That <hi>as many as look for juſtification by works,</hi> whether in whole or in part, <hi>are fallen from grace, and Chriſt ſhall nothing profit them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This oppoſition alſo is to be remembred againſt all ſuch, as teach us to expect juſtification by faith, as it is a work: the oppoſition is none, that I can conceive, betwixt the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the work of faith, and the work of love.</p>
               <p>The next thing here offered to our notice, is a diſtinction of rewards; and it lies thus; There is a reward paid, as Debt; there is another given of Favour.</p>
               <p>And it is of ſome uſe in that grand queſtion betwixt us and our Adverſaries, touching the merit of good works;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105203:26"/>which from no ground they ofter infer, then from this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall be rewarded. To this the anſwer is, Not every work that hath a reward, is by and by meritorious; except the reward be paid as debt to the work: Now the reward that is given to our obedience, is given of favour, not paid of debt: and that we prove thus: Firſt, becauſe the ſame that is called the reward of obedience, is ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>A point worthy of our attentive conſideration, for the magnifying of Gods mercy, and furtherance of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. It was grace enough in God, that he was pleaſed to create us in ſo excellent a condition, only through deſire to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105203:27"/>communicate himſelf unto us; and for it, he might juſtly claim obedience to any his commandements, eſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to our abilities, even without any promiſe of farther recompence: but loe, that nothing ſhould be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our encouragement, when he propounds a law to be obeyed, he alſo covenants with him, to crown his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with immortality; <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Lev. 18.15. Rom. 10.5. But, ſee mans great unthankfulneſs to God, and unmercifulneſs to himſelf; not contented with the happineſs preſently enjoyed, nor with the hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality promiſed; he affects not to be (like) God as he was, but to be <hi>(equall) unto him in knowledg, Gen.</hi> 3.5. He throws off the yoak of obedience, and thereby deprives himſelf juſtly of all the happineſs he had, or could hope for; plunges himſelf into miſery endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs; except God in mercy provide an eſcape. Now, behold the unſearchable riches of the mercy, and love of God toward man; loath that he ſhould periſh, he enters another courſe for his recovery; ſends his own Son out of his boſome, in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, by obedience unto death to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie juſtice, that there might yet be a way for his mercy to overflow in the ſalvation of his choſen; and in him enters a new league with man, for reſtoring righteouſneſs, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, under a condition ſo reaſonable, as none more could be deviſed; believe only in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, thy ſins are pardoned; righteouſneſs reſtored, ſalvation recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord what is man</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi>) conſidering a bleſſing far inferior, <hi>that thou ſo reckoneſt on him? or the ſon of man, that thou ſo viſiteſt him,</hi> Pſal. 8.4.

I doubt not, but thoſe that have felt in any degree, the miſery to which the Law hath ſentenced them; and withall, how impoſſible it is for the law to reſtore

               <p>That our hearts may be yet more inflamed to this duty; conſider we, I beſeech you the preferment and property God hath given man, in this mercy, even above Angels, creatures by naturall condition, more excellent then he:
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> Angels ſinned, God ſent them no Mediator; they fell, by not obeying; God hath made them no promiſe of riſing, by believing: Man ſinned, God ſent his Son to propitiate; man fell by diſobedience hath promiſe of reſtoring by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: Let them periſh everlaſtingly with helliſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, that acknowledg not this mercy; or, that renouncing the righteouſneſs of faith, ſeek to eſtabliſh their own in works of the Law.</p>

ſo, no leſs for the multiplying of our comfort and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hope of righteouſneſs, yea, though we have no works, ſuch as the law preſcribes to juſtification; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold another mean of righteouſneſs provided for ſinners, even faith in him that juſtifies the ungodly: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what do we vexing and breaking our hearts, for ſins once committed now repented? A muſtard ſeed of faith commands a mountain of ſin to the bottome of the ſea: What if <hi>Moſes</hi> be ſo ſtrict, that none but exact juſtice will ſerve to juſtification? <hi>One greater then Moſes is here,</hi> that tels us faith is available to righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And to the end the conſcience of ſins, after faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, might not overthrow hope of righteouſneſs, mark the deſcription of him, to whom faith is carried, as to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object: He is ſuch an one, as juſtifies the ungodly; and from whom ſinners, great ſinners believing, (in believing) may expect juſtification.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>God juſtifieth the ungodly]</hi> How? may ſome men ſay: by infuſing righteouſneſs, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting righteouſneſs, ſay ſome of our Divines: by remitting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105203:28"/>ſins, faith <hi>Cajetane;</hi> and of our own Interpreters, not a few. Let us ſee whether hath more truth.</p>
               <p>The two former have their agreements, and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: they agree in this; Firſt, That to juſtifie in this place, ſignifies to make righteous: They differ in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how we are made righteous in this ſenſe, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeems to mean; whether by infuſion, or by imputation: Papiſts, eſpecially <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will have it to be done, only by infuſing the habits of righteouſneſs; as faith, charity, &amp;c. whereby we are made formally, and by inheritance righteous.</p>
               <p>Now, in handling this queſtion, we muſt remember that its not denyed of us, that God doth make us juſt, by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing righteouſneſs; For, we confeſs, God by his ſpirit doth ſanctifie us throughout, and infuſe the habits of inherent righteouſneſs, as they call it, whereby we are fitted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe morall juſtice, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. Neither deny we, but that in the time when he juſtifieth us, by imputation, as ſome ſpeak; he alſo ſanctifieth us, and works a begun conformity to the law.</p>
               <p>But this is that we enquire of, whether this infuſed righteouſneſs be that, whereby we are made juſt; ſo, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe and ſentence of the law, we ſtand juſt at the day of Gods juſtice. This they affirm; we all, with one conſent, deny, and that upon theſe grounds. Firſt, For that Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. that had his ſhare herein, as far as moſt; yet profeſſeth he had not, nor expected juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby: What is his meaning, that he did not thereby ſtand juſt before God according to the ſentence of the law? In form thus; <hi>Pauls</hi> righteouſneſs inherent made not him ſtand juſt before God according to the tenour of the law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> No man is made ſo juſt by inherent righteouſneſs, as to ſtand juſt thereby before God, according to the law. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>David,</hi> excellently endued with this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet deprecates tryall by judgment, acording to the law, upon this reaſon, In Gods ſight no man ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105203:28"/>The arguments are two. Firſt, If <hi>David</hi> fear the tryall of Gods judgment by the law, that had ſo great a meaſure of righteouſneſs; then, is not that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby we ſtand juſt before God, according to the law; for a man having that righteouſneſs, which the law requires, needeth not fear tryall by exacteſt juſtice: but, <hi>David</hi> deprecates judgment: <hi>Ergò.</hi> 2. View his reaſon; No living man ſhall be juſtified in thy ſight; to wit, if thou deal with him in judgment, according to the law: <hi>Theodoret,</hi> paraphraſing the text expounds. <hi>Novienim fieri non poſſe, ut aliquis ſine paenâ à tuo tribunali diſcedat; ſi enim hominum vitae regulam legum â te latarum appones, nemo ſecundum has vixiſſe videbitur:</hi> And Auguſtine, <hi>quantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet rectus mihi videar, producis tu de thesſauro tuo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, coaptas me ad eam, et pravus invenior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe teſtimonies ſo direct, what anſwers give they? Perhaps they will ſay, they ſpeak of actuall juſtice, not of habituall; and therefore are impertinently alledged to the purpoſe in hand. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to examine that diſtinction, we ſhall ſee, they conclude as well againſt habituall, as againſt actuall righteouſnes: For is our actuall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuch, as may not endure the cenſure of the law; then certainly, it more then ſeems, the habits whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, are not ſo perfect, as after the law they ſhould be: For, what ſhould let the perfect habit of faith, to bring forth a perfect act of faith? &amp;c. ſith therefore the acts are imperfect, ſo are the habits alſo.</p>
               <p>But, other anſwers they have many, and variable; Firſt, that the Prophet ſpeaks only of juſtice, which a man hath of himſelf, not of God;
<note place="margin">Bellarm. in Pſal. 143. &amp; lib. 4. cap. 20.) de juſtific.</note> and that he denies a man to be juſtified thereby. But, howſoever, or whenſoever <hi>David</hi> had his righteouſneſs, if it were juſtice, ſuch as in the law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why deprecates he judgment? He needs not fear Gods Tribuniall, that hath the iuſtice of the law, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto God; For its written, <hi>The man that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> Rom. 10, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:105203:29"/>
Their ſecond <hi>Anſwer</hi> is this; That David deprecates judgement, becauſe of his veniall ſins; and they, forſooth, though they deſerve puniſhment, in exact juſtice, yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not juſtification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well then, belike; theſe lighter ſinnes though a man have, He may be juſtified according to the Law. What is then become of that ſentence of the Law, curſing all men to the pit of Hell, <hi>that continue not in all things</hi> (little, or great) <hi>written in the Book of the Law, to do them?</hi> Gal. 3.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And, are theſe the ſins onely, for which David feared judgement? then hear: either veniall ſins hinder juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or elſe David doth ill give this as a reaſon, why he was ſo loath to have the Lord enter into judgement with him; becauſe no fleſh ſhould be juſtified in Gods ſight. In a word, draw out the Prophets ſpeech ſomething largely, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Expoſition; The ſenſe will be this: Oh Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, ſpare calling me to reckoning for my veniall ſins; For, in reſpect of them, ſith no man is free from them, <hi>no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their third anſwer; <hi>No fleſh ſhall be juſtified;</hi> becauſe, our Righteouſneſs, though it be true, and pure in it ſelf; yet, compared to the infinite righteouſneſs of Gods Nature, it ſeems no righteouſneſs: as, the light of a candle, though it be light, yet compared to that of the ſunne, is no light: and this expoſition hath the Authority of ſome Fathers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> With this diſtinction of righteouſneſs I find no fault. It hath the teſtimony of Fathers, and the warrant of Scripture, Job 4.18. But, is this the reaſon, why David ſo much feared to come to judgement, becauſe he wanted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs comparable to the Eſſential righteouſneſs of God? Who can think it? it ſufficeth to any man, at the day of judgement, to bring unto God the righteouſneſs, which the Law preſcribes; neither need he fear puniſhment, becauſe he wants righteouſnes comparable to that,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5.</note> which God hath, as God: and thus Theod. Aug. and others interpret; that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105203:29"/>his deſire to be free from judgement was, becauſe he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not to the (rule) of righteouſneſs: Now, is Gods Eſſentiall righteouſneſs The Rule, after which in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our righteouſneſs muſt be ſquared? <hi>Dic ſodes?</hi> I think, rather the Law of God. Saint Hierome, in his time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged this Scripture againſt Pelagius, to prove, that no man ever was, or could be ſo Holy, as to live without ſin; what anſwer receives he? ſaith Hierome,
<note place="margin">S. Hieron. epiſt. ad Cteſiph.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoc teſtimonium ſub nomine pietatis novâ argumentatione deludunt; aiunt enim, ad comparationem Dei, nullum eſſe Perfectum: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous they might be, according to that required in the Law: not ſo in compariſon to the Eſſentiall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</hi> Hear Hieroms anſwer; <hi>quaſi hoc ſcriptura di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit,</hi> as who ſay, this Scripture affirmed ſo much; No, ſaith Hierom, but when it ſaith, <hi>[None ſhall be juſtified in thy ſight] hoc intelligi vult, quòd etiam qui hominibus ſancti videntur, Dei ſcientiae, atque notitiae nequaquam Sancti ſunt: Homo enim videt in facie Deus autem in corde:</hi> That is, <hi>This is the meaning, That even they that ſeem to men Holy, to Gods knowledge are not ſo; For, man looks on the face, God on the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One reaſon more I propound, againſt their concluſion, and ſo proceed.</p>
               <p>The Righteouſneſs whereby a man ſtands juſt before God, according to the Law, muſt be for the matter, Right; for the meaſure, Pure; for continuance, Firm: The terms are Bernards: It muſt be <hi>Recta,</hi> according to Rule; <hi>Pura,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard de verb. Eſa. ſer.</hi> 4.</note> free from ſtain; <hi>Firma,</hi> without wavering, or interruption: He ſeems, in fit terms to expreſs the Apoſtle, citing that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Moſes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and certainly, if our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fail in any of theſe, by ſentence of the Law, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption let us hear out of Bernard; <hi>Noſtra (ſi qua eſt) humilis juſtitia, recta forſitan eſt, ſed non pura; niſi forte meliores nos eſſe credimus, quàm patres noſtros; qui non minùs veraciter, quàm humiliter aiebant; omnis juſtitia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105203:30"/>tanquam pannus menſtruatae mulieris: quomodo enim pura juſtitia, ubi adhuc non poteſt culpa deeſſe?</hi> Ours. 1. no better then our Fathers. 2. Not free from fault: therefore, not pure, or perfect.</p>
               <p>And, I wonder much, how Papiſts, ſticking ſo cloſe to their diſtinction, of firſt, and ſecond juſtification, can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the perfection of inherent righteouſneſs? For, is there a ſecond juſtification, whereby we are made more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? it is apparent therefore, that inherent righteouſneſs is never perfected in this life:
<note place="margin">Perfectio viae, &amp; Patriae.</note> It is idle, when they diſtinguiſh perfection, into that of the Way; and the other, of the Countrey: For, if by it we are juſtified, <hi>in via,</hi> according to the Law; we muſt by it alſo, be perfected, <hi>in via;</hi> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as no righteouſneſs, but perfect, is approved by the Law.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, That the righteouſneſs whereby we ſtand juſt, according to the Law, is not inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If the righteouſneſs, whereby we are thus juſt, ſtand in the habits of <hi>faith, hope, charity, patience meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c. How is it, that the Lord when he juſtifies an ungodly man believing, is ſaid to count his faith to righteouſneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4.? perhaps, becauſe that is our righteouſneſs, <hi>Ex parte; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page!</hi> Then, when Paul concludes Abraham not to have been juſtified by works, becauſe he was juſtified by faith, his meaning is this: Abraham was juſtified by faith, in ſome part; <hi>ergò,</hi> by works in no part: How eaſie were it to denie his conſequence. Thus, though in part of Faith, yet he muſt be in part alſo of Works; and ſo the Argument follows not.</p>
               <p>And again, The ſtate of the queſtion, ſo largely diſputed in this Epiſtle, betwixt faith and works, muſt be this: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be juſtified in part of Faith? But theſe are abſurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If therefore faith be counted our righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo, In part; Why, (I wonder) Faith, more then Chariey, or Hope? &amp;c. Why ſaith the Apoſtle ſo oft? Faith is counted to Righteouſneſs; never ſo, of Charitie? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105203:30"/>
                  <hi>Denominatio fit ex parte potiori? Apage!</hi> I dare ſay, by their notes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. they will never abaſe Charity ſo farre, as to give Faith the preheminence, in this point of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
               <p>Perhaps now it will be exſpected, that I ſhould anſwer their objections, in this point; but that hath been already in a great part done, <hi>ad cap.</hi> 3. and beſides, the grounds now laid, afford anſwer ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Proceed we therefore to the next explication: <hi>God justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ungodly,]</hi> that is, makes him righteous, by imputing righteouſneſs: and if the queſtion be, What righteouſneſs? The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; whether of his life, or death; it is not ſo pertinent here to enquire: For, we are now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſpute, whether imputation be the means, whereby we are made juſt in the ſight of God: and this alſo will fitlieſt be handled in the next verſe; thither therefore I refer it. Onely, it ſhall not be amiſs to ſee, upon what reaſon our Divines thus interpret the word of juſtifying, by making righteous; That acception of the word in Scripture, being ſo rare, that ſcarce in any other place it is found: Their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, becauſe the word, when it is taken, to acquit, can in no wiſe fit this place; becauſe the Lord profeſſeth ſo often, He will not juſtifie the wicked, in this ſenſe ſo as to acquit him, or hold him righteous whiles he continues wicked: It ſhould ſeem therefore, that when Paul ſaith, he juſtifieth the ungodly; his meaning is, He makes him righteous that he may acquit him: But what if that ſentence of Moſes be underſtood, with the exception of the Goſpel? Except he repent, and believe the Goſpel: Surely, though the Lord profeſs, He will not clear the the wicked,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7.</note> that are impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently ſuch; yet we know he teſtifieth in the ſame place, that he will forgive tranſgreſſion, iniquity, and ſinne, to the penitent, and believing.</p>
               <p>The laſt thus: God juſtifieth the ungodly,

               <p>TO the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> taken from <hi>Moſes,</hi> is adjoyned the teſtimony of <hi>David</hi> amongſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: And <hi>Theodorets</hi> reaſon of the choice is not to be contemned; for <hi>Abraham</hi> lived before the Law; and now he ſhews that <hi>David,</hi> who lived under the Law, gave Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to Faith.</p>
               <p>The rendring differs:
<note place="margin">Beza. Piſcator.</note> 
                  <hi>David deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of that man:</hi> others had rather thus, <hi>David ſaith, Bleſſedneſs to be that mans, unto whom, &amp;c.</hi> In the iſſue is no great odds. The ſumme of the argument is this;</p>
               <p>If <hi>David</hi> ſay, That bleſſedneſſe is that mans, to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſs without works, Then is no man juſtified by works: But <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Bleſſedneſs is that mans, to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works; <hi>Ergò,</hi> No man is juſtified by works. The <hi>minor</hi> hath its proof, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8. borrowed from <hi>Pſalme</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>But may ſome ſay, How follows the Propoſition, that if a man be bleſſed that hath righteouſneſs without works imputed to him, then no man is juſtified by works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus, as I conceive preſcribing to no man. If bleſſedneſs be onely that mans that hath righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105203:32"/>works imputed; then juſtification cannot be by works; Inaſmuch as bleſſedneſs is his onely that is juſtified, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being a part of bleſſedneſs,</p>
               <p>If any Juſticiary ſhall object, That the excluſive particle <hi>(onely)</hi> is not extant in the Apoſtle; and that, though he be bleſſed that hath righteouſneſs imputed without works; yet may he be bleſſed alſo that hath righteouſneſs purchaſed by works: Let this ſuffice him for anſwer; That there is one onely way of all mens juſtification; for elſe, how fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>Pauls</hi> argument? <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by Works, but by Faith; <hi>Ergò,</hi> No other man. After this conceit, a man might mannerly deny the Apoſtles conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and tell him, that though <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by Faith, yet another man may be iuſtified by Works.</p>
               <p>Now to make way to the particulars obſervable in this ſixth verſe. It may be ſaid, that the words are no where extant in <hi>David,</hi> and how then ſaith the Apoſtle that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>The man is bleſſed to whom righteouſneſs without works is imputed? David</hi> indeed ſaith, that he is bleſſed that hath not his ſins imputed; no where, that righteouſneſs without works is imputed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the words be no where extant in <hi>David,</hi> yet the ſenſe is; and though he ſpeak not in expreſſe words, yet he ſpeaks it in effect, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by iuſt and neceſſary conſequence it may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: for he that ſaith, <hi>A man is bleſſed that hath not his ſins imputed,</hi> ſaith in effect, that <hi>he is bleſſed, that hath righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without works imputed.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105203:33"/>One ſwims in ſenſuall pleaſures, and thinks himſelf bleſſed, that he hath wherewith to glut his ſenſuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; ſaith <hi>Tully,</hi> a ſpeech better beſeeming beaſts, then men; another hath his caſtle of wealth, and no misfortune he thinks can approach him; but, <hi>wretched man, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits it to win the whole world, and loſe thine own ſoul? what ranſome wilt thou give for the ſins of thy ſoul?</hi> A third feeds upon the breath of the people, and thinks himſelf a God becauſe the people ſo applaud him; but miſerable man that thou art, the baſeſt vermin can conſume thee: The laſt more generous, place their felicity in the action of vertue; but, wilt thou hear who ſaid, <hi>without faith, its not poſsible to pleaſe God?</hi> and the moſt glorious actions of a man not juſtified, are but glittering ſins. In a word, goe over all the bleſſedneſs, that the world fancyeth to it ſelf out of Chriſt; Thou ſhalt be forced to ſay of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; <hi>This alſo is vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> was ever any man more happily miſerable in this kinde, then he in the top of the golden empire? yet ſee him in the middeſt of his pompe, and glory, <hi>ſhaken with the fingers writing on the wall, Dan.</hi> 5.

And, let Gods children partakers of his high favour, herewith comfort themſelves, in all thoſe outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that preſs them; The were but Godleſs Epicures, that placed felicity in vacuity of grief, and that could diſcern no other happineſs of a man, but when ſenſuall pleaſures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him: If we believe the Authour of happineſs, there is more bleſſedneſs, even in Chriſtian ſorrow, then in all ſuch heatheniſh pleaſures;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6.</note> yea, afflictions are ſo farre from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the happy ſtate of a juſtified man, that they rather confirm and encreaſe it; while they kill the corruption that is in them; and ſo aſſure them, that the ſinnes are remitted, which are thus mortified. And, ſhall any Chriſtian now think, he is therefore miſerable, whiles he feels ſmart of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, when he knows his ſins are remitted? The heathen could ſay, that vice onely made miſerable, and that a wiſe man loſt not his happineſs, no not in <hi>equuleo.</hi> Chriſtianity much more teacheth the ſinner, whoſe ſins ſtand ſtill in force againſt him, to be onely wretched; and the juſtified man, in the greateſt outward afflictions, to be bleſſed, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe juſtified: And, I would but know of ſuch weaklings, that think themſelves miſerable, becauſe afflicted: Whether they think the happier, the glutton with his Belly-chear or the Lazar pinched with hunger? David every day afflicted, or thoſe gallants, that ſpend their dayes in mirth, and in a moment go down to hell? Auguſtine would ſoon reſolve, <hi>Hîc ure, hîc ſeca,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut in aeternum parcas:</hi> For me thus I reſolve, Let me have my ſins pardoned, my perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, for outward preſſures, I ſay, as David, lo here I am, <hi>Let the Lord do with me what ſeemeth good in his eyes,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. See we now the deſcription of the man thus Bleſſed: He is ſuch an one, as to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſs, without works.</p>
               <p>In the words, three things. 1. He hath righteouſneſs. 2. The quality of his righteouſneſs, <hi>without works.</hi> 3. The manner how he is partaker of it, <hi>by Imputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, that in juſtification, we are made partakers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105203:34"/>of righteouſneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. Circumciſion was to Abraham a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, which he had being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed: Paul deſires to be found in Chriſt, having the righteouſneſs, which is by faith of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it is true that Bellarmine hath, that juſtification hath the name, <hi>à termino ad quem,</hi> becauſe, that thereby we are made partakers of righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. We are ſaid to be made <hi>The righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Rom</hi> 5. <hi>To be made righteous.</hi> This then, let ſtand for a ground, That in juſtification, Righteouſneſs is imparted to us.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, it is enquired, What righteouſneſs this is? of Righteouſneſs, in this queſtion of juſtification, we find two kinds. One called our own righteouſneſs; or, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is by the Law. The other, the righteouſneſs of God, ſometimes called the righteouſneſs of faith, or, the righteouſneſs, which is by the faith of Jeſus, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. our own Righteouſneſs, or, the righteouſneſs of the Law, is the perfect obedience of the Law performed by ourſelves: The righteouſneſs of God, is the righteouſneſs which God in Chriſt performed, fulfilling the Law for us; called the Righteouſneſs of Faith, becauſe, we are by faith made partakers of it.
<note place="margin">See, Illyric. &amp; Zanch. ad Phil. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſhall demand, what the difference between theſe two is? I anſwer, They differ not at all in the matter, or ſubſtance of righteouſneſs; for the righteouſneſs, which by Chriſt we are made partakers of, is that very righteouſneſs, which the Law preſcribes, namely, perfect obedience to the Law: but they differ <hi>efficiente;</hi> our righteouſneſs, that we in our perſons perform to the law.</p>
               <p>And, that it is no other righteouſneſs, then what the law preſcribes for ſubſtance, whereof in juſtification we are made partakers, that one place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. is clear; where, the Apoſtle giving a reaſon, why the Jews that followed the law of righteouſneſs, attained not the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is, as moſt interpret, the righteouſneſs which the law preſcribes; The reaſon was, becauſe they ſought it not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105203:35"/>by faith, but by the works of the law; as if he had ſaid, Had they ſought it, <hi>by believing,</hi> as they did, <hi>by working;</hi> they had attained the righteouſneſs which the law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to juſtification: The righteouſneſs of the law, then, we obtain by faith, to juſtification; It is therefore the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which in juſtification we are made partakers of.</p>
               <p>How then is it ſaid, to be righteouſneſs, <hi>without works?</hi> I anſwer, In reſpect of us, <hi>without works;</hi> In reſpect of Chriſt the performer not ſo.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the means, how it is imputed unto us; and that is, <hi>by Imputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imputation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Imputation of righteouſneſs What it is.</note> in this caſe, we may thus deſcribe; To be an act of God aſcribing to us the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and counting it ours no leſs, then if we had in our own perſons performed it: Touching it, it is enquired, whether there be any ſuch act of God in our juſtification: Papiſts generally deny it, and make the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to avail to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, onely as a cauſe procuring to us remiſſion of ſins, and the gifts of the holy Ghoſt: That which our Divines hitherto have conſented in, is this; That the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not onely the cauſe for which the Lord remits ſins, &amp;c. but the very thing, whereby we are made righteous in the ſight of God. Their reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we are ſaid to be made righteous by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. ſhall we ſay, as by a procuring cauſe? nay rather formally; For ſo are we made ſinners, by the tranſgreſſion of Adam: And, the purpoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in that compariſon betwixt Adam, and Chriſt, ſeems to be this; To ſhew, that it is no abſurd thing, that we ſhould be made righteous, by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; ſeeing we were made ſinners, by Adams diſobedience. <hi>Inſt.</hi> But, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams diſobedience was not ours <hi>by imputation?</hi> but we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were actours therein, by an implicite act, ſinning in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? To ſay nothing, that the whole ſtream of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters judge otherwiſe; Let it be granted, that we were actours in Adams ſinne, being in his loins; Why not alſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105203:35"/>actours in Chriſts obedience, being one myſtically with him, by bond of the ſpirit?</p>
               <p n="2">2.

VERS, 7, 8. There followeth in theſe verſes proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> in the former ſyllogiſme. <hi>David</hi> appropriates bleſſedneſs to the man, that hath righteouſneſs imputed without works: for he appropriates it to him, whoſe ſinns are remitted.
<note place="margin">Cajetane. Paraeus. Piſcator.</note> How follows the argument? Some thus conceive it; The Apoſtle (ſay they) thus collects the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>David;</hi> becauſe in this ſpeech of <hi>David,</hi> there is no mention made of any of our works; but onely of Gods actions, in remitting, covering, not imputing ſinne: ſome gather it from equipollence of the phraſes; for it is all one not to impute ſin, and to impute righteouſneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he that by not imputation of ſin, is made <hi>non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> is thereby made <hi>iustus;</hi> there being no <hi>medium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>non</hi>-ſinner, and a righteous man; betwixt abſence of all ſin, and having of righteouſneſs.

               <p>May I have leave to interpoſe my ſentence. What if the conſecution ſtand thus? The iuſtified man, by <hi>Davids</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, hath <hi>(quá talis)</hi> remiſſion of ſins; therefore he hath imputation of righteouſneſs without works: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as where ſins are remitted, there can be no iuſtice but imputative; every tranſgreſſion of the Law depriving of that iuſtice, which ſtands in works; foraſmuch as the Law to righteouſneſs requires obſervance of every particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therein preſcribed, abſtinence from every particular ſin therein forbidden; ſith therefore, Whoſoever is iuſtified, hath ſinnes remitted; it follows, that his bleſſedneſs ariſeth from imputation of righteouſneſs without works. <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Docti.</hi>

The coherence we ſee. Let us now view the ſenſe of the words; What difference, may ſome ſay, betwixt remitting, covering, and not imputing ſinn? <hi>Anſw.

The puniſhment. Now ſin is in reſpect of the offence, remitted; in reſpect of the turpitude, covered; in reſpect of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, not imputed: ſuch like niceties many I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite out of interpreters.

That we may the better ſee the my ſtery of their iniquity, in this point; let us a little enquire how many things are to be conſidered in actuall ſins: For, as touching concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, we will touch it only by the way.</p>
               <p>In every actuall ſin we muſt conſider, 1. The act it ſelf, with the <hi>anomie</hi> thereof, wherein the nature of ſin conſiſts, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.4.2. The effects, and conſequents flowing therefrom; as 1. the offence and diſpleaſure of God; 2. as <hi>Cajetan</hi> cals it the turpitude thereof;

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Maculam,</hi> the blemiſhing of the ſoul, or perſon of a ſinner; and the deprivall of that beauty, and comelineſs of it, wherewith by grace it is adorned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The corruption, or, deſtroying of that naturall good, that ſtands in the ſubjection of man to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The encreaſe of prones to the ſame ſin.</p>
               <p>A Third conſequent, is the guilt, that lyeth upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſinner, and his liableneſs to puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The fourth let be the puniſhment it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Let us now apply their concluſion to ſome controverſies betwixt us, and them: Sins, they ſay, when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, are utterly aboliſhed, and extinct; yea, ſo done away, that there remains nothing of them, that can be reputed ſin: then I hope we may aſſume of every ſin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, that it is wholly aboliſhed. What think we then of originall ſin, in infants after Baptiſme? Is it pardoned, or no? Yes, for Baptiſme ſo takes away ſin, that it leaves nothing, that hath the true and proper nature of ſin. Well then, how comes it to paſs, that many of them dye, before ever they had ability to commit actuall ſins? Have they nothing left, that hath the nature of ſin, and yet taſt they of death, <hi>the wages of ſin? Rom.</hi> 6.23. Far be it, that the Judg of all the world ſhould not do right, in puniſhing an innocent, that hath nothing left in him that hath the true, and proper nature of ſin.</p>
               <p>Again, had <hi>David</hi> true remiſſion of his adultery, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105203:38"/>murther, yea, or no? Yes, no doubt; for <hi>Nathan</hi> telleth him, <hi>the Lord hath put away his ſin,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. Well yet, <hi>David</hi> muſt be puniſhed, though his ſin be put away as a Clowd, and there remains no foot-print of it, nothing that could be reputed ſin: Help us to reconcile theſe, or elſe bluſh at your contractions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Methinks the ſin being wholly aboliſhed, the whole <hi>reatus</hi> accrewing to the perſon thereby, ſhould be withall extinct; for, what is it, that binds us over to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of any ſort, temperall, or eternal? ſin only, I trow; yet, according to their judgment, in remiſſion of many ſins, there remains <hi>reatus poenae Temporalis;</hi> as they give inſtance in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe. Well, one thing <hi>I</hi> perceive, remiſſion of ſins is any thing, but what it is; that is, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and diſcharge of the ſinner from puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Let us now come to ſet down, what our judgment is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning remiſſion of ſins: We thus conceive it, out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to be in property of ſpeech,
<note place="margin">Cyprian. de Orat. Dom.</note> nothing but <hi>Venia delicti,</hi> the pardon of ſins; and that, in common appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, is the diſcharge of the offendor from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſin; and that which pardon or remiſſion hath, in property of ſpeech, reſpect unto, is the puniſhment of ſin. The firſt phraſe in <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech, hath this meaning; <hi>Their ſins are forgiven,</hi> or, <hi>pardoned;</hi> that is, not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>What is the covering of ſin? the ſame that pardon is, in effect, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> ſave only, that the phraſe is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall: unfold it, it is this; as things that are covered, are not ſeen, ſo ſins when God will pardon them, are not ſeen of him; that is not ſeen with regard, or which ſuch notice, as that he ſhould puniſh them: (Are) they then, and not ſeen of him, <hi>to whoſe eyes all things are naked, and
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13.</note> uncovered:</hi> or, is there any covering ſo thick, or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitrable, as that the eyes of God cannot pierce through it, to diſcern what lyeth under? <hi>Anſw.</hi> None that ſo hides, as that he cannot ſee, or know, that they are done. <hi>Iſai.</hi>

But, (are) they ſtill, where they are not imputed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Actuall ſins, as acts after committing, have no being, ſave only in Gods, and our own remembrance: <hi>Actus tranſit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thomas,</hi> the ſinfull action is tranſient, and vaniſhing; that only which reſults from the action remains, As, 1.

The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 5.

               <p>A ſecond queſtion here uſually diſcuſſed, is, Whether whole juſtification ſtands in remiſſion of ſins? I ſhall not need to ſhew how fitly this place affords the queſtion; it is ſhewn plentifully by others. In this queſtion my purpoſe is not to deal at all againſt Papiſts; but to handle it as it is now controverted among our own Divines.</p>
               <p>The anſwer thereto, by thoſe that think iuſtification in this queſtion, to ſignifie nothing but acquitall and diſcharge from ſin, muſt needs be this; That it ſtands onely in remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinns: for, what is it to acquit from ſin but to remit ſins? And this ſeems ſtrange to me, that men urging that ſignification of the word to be proper to this queſtion, can ſeek for any other thing to make up the entirety of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Is it nothing to be juſtified, but to be acquit from ſin? then ſure to be juſtified, implies no more but to have ſins remitted; Either therefore we muſt grant, that to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, in this queſtion, ſignifies ſomewhat more, or elſe that whole juſtification ſtands in remiſſion of ſins. And let that be the firſt argument; Juſtification, in Scripture, ſignifies onely a quittal; <hi>Ergò.</hi> To this anſwer muſt be made, if any be to purpoſe, that to <hi>iuſtifie</hi> hath ſome other ſignification; ſo ſome labour to ſhew, That it ſignifies ſometimes <hi>to make
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105203:40"/>juſt,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. ſometimes <hi>to account,</hi> or <hi>pronounce juſt,</hi> or <hi>to give teſtimony of righteouſneſs, Luke</hi> 7.29. ſometimes, <hi>to give reward of righteouſneſs,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.32, &amp;c. Whether theſe ſatisfie or no, I had rather others judge, then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond reaſon is from this place, but diverſly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; ſome thus. <hi>David</hi> gives no where a full deſcription of juſtification? <hi>Ergò,</hi> Whole juſtification is abſolved in remiſſion of ſins. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be ſhewed, that either <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> intended here to deſcribe, much leſſe perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to define, juſtification: For, what though the Apoſtle doth purpoſely diſpute of the (means) of juſtificatior; muſt he needs therefore alledge this teſtimony of <hi>David,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the (nature) of it? He proves by this teſtimony, that juſtification is not by works, becauſe the juſtified man hath ſins forgiven in his juſtification: and ſo the argument follows well, though juſtification be not here perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; ſee <hi>ſuprà, in Expoſition.</hi> nay conſider that by this means his argument is as nothing: for, if remiſſion of ſins be whole juſtification, will it follow thence, that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified without works? <hi>Excipiat quispiam:</hi> Let juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtand in remiſsion of ſins, that may yet be procured by works. Others thus gather it; To pronounce <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> to <hi>impute righteouſneſs,</hi> to <hi>remit ſins</hi> are all one with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <hi>Ergò,</hi> Juſtification ſtands onely in remiſsion of ſins. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Antecedent is untrue.</p>
               <p>Their third argument is that teſtimony, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the firſt place tells us, That by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſins, he means juſtification from thoſe things, by which by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, we could not be juſtified, &amp;c. And in the other, he ſhews we are reconciled, by not having ſins imputed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt, the adverſe part would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that there is ſhewed, Juſtification ſtands in remiſsion of ſins, <hi>ex parte,</hi> that being our part of juſtification; but an other part there is and that is making us righteous, with the righteouſneſs of the Law, which we have by imputation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105203:40"/>from Chriſt. To the ſecond, the anſwer would be made, that our reconciliation ſtands partly in not imputing ſinne; and it is uſuall to declare the whole by ſome part; as whole redemption by remiſsion of ſins <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. yet may we not ſay, that redemption ſtands onely in remiſsion of ſinns. Their chief reaſon is this; for that juſtification is aſcribed onely to the bloud of Chriſt; now, that bloud of Chriſt procured us nothing but remiſsion of ſins. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the bloud of Chriſt, is there put <hi>ſynecdochicè,</hi> for the whole obedience of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The other opinion is this, That juſtification hath two parts: 1. Our diſcharge from our ſinns. 2. Our furniſhing with the righteouſneſs of the Law. Their reaſons are theſe: Firſt, for that we are ſaid to be made righteous by the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obedience of Chriſt <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. as well as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have remiſsion of ſins by his bloud. <hi>Ob.</hi> By obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be underſtood his obedience in ſuffering. 2. That the Law ſince the fall, requires to juſtification not onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for breaches, by puniſhment; but alſo that the obedience therein preſcribed be performed; elſe ſtill the curſe lies on us. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is anſwered, 1. That we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law but under grace. 2. That by remiſsion of ſins, we have the righteouſneſs of the Law; for all ſins, as well of omiſsion, as of commiſsion, are cleared in the bloud of Chriſt. 3. Becauſe God in his word hath preſcribed no other way to life, but perfect obedience to the Law? It is anſwered, that in the Goſpel another way is preſcribed <hi>Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 16. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. The Meſsiah is promiſed not onely to expiate ſin, but alſo to <hi>bring everlaſting righteouſneſs. Anſw.</hi> What if that may be underſtood of that we perform in the ſtudie of Sanctification?</p>
               <p>Well, whatever become of that controverſie, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion we have evidently hence, That in Juſtification we have perfect remiſsion of ſin; See <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. Papiſts themſelves herein conſent with us, as we have ſeen before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:105203:41"/>
And will it not hence follow that therefore we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the whole guilt and puniſhment of our ſins? Here now they-begin to mince it, for ſtabliſhing their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſatisfaction to be made to Gods juſtice;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sasbout, ad loc. Bellarm. ad Pſal.</hi> 31.</note> and our releaſe is, they ſay, onely from guilt of eternall puniſhment. The queſtion hath been largely diſcuffed, <hi>ad cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Here onely I would have them reconcile their two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Firſt, that when ſins are remitted, they are utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and aboliſhed, ſo that there is nothing left, that can be reputed ſinne. Secondly, that there remains unto him that hath his ſins thus remitted, part of the guilt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated by his own ſatisfaction. Hear a ſubtile ſhift; Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins is either totall, or partiall: Totall, when it is remitted <hi>quoad omnem poenam;</hi> Partiall, when it is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely <hi>quoad culpam, &amp; poenam aeternam.</hi> Now, where the remiſsion is totall, there is no reſervation of any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where partiall, onely in reſpect of eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there remaineth ſtill <hi>reatus poenae temporalis. Contra.</hi> But I demand, whereon is that guilt founded? Me thinks it muſt needs be on ſomething that hath <hi>veram &amp; propriam rationem peccati;</hi>

               <p>THe ſcope and dependence of this paſſage is diverſly conceived: Some think the Apoſtle here propounds a new argument, for juſtification by Faith, againſt juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Works; and theſe alſo diverſly collect it.

Others thus;
<note place="margin">Paraeus ad loc.</note> If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by faith, then muſt all men, whether circumciſed or uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed be ſo juſtified; But <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The conſequence of the propoſition they imagine to have this proof; becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is father of both people, and they both his ſonnes; wherefore by good conſequent they think it follows; that as be was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, ſo others muſt be ſith there is one reaſon of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

To ſhew that the bleſsing of juſtification belongs indifferently to Jews and Gentiles believing: A point touched before <hi>chap.</hi> 3. and here again reſumed, and more purpoſely proved, becauſe he had immediately before made mention of <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification: and their gueſs is not without ground, that think the Apoſtle now frames anſwer to that ſecond <hi>quaere</hi> of Jews. <hi>Rom.</hi> 301. <hi>What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Circumciſion?</hi> which to this place he hath purpoſely deferred, becauſe from <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe it receives fitteſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Neither let it ſeem ſtrange, that the Apoſtle ſhould thus digreſs from his principall concluſion; ſith we know, it is frequent with him in his paſſage, as well to clear doubt, as to confirm his purpoſe. And for the ſcope thus far: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Now, the paſſage to this Concluſion, is by way of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſis: Came this bleſſedneſs then? &amp;c.</hi> Wherein we have 1. The doubt. 2. The reaſon of it. 3. The ſolution. The doubt is, whether this bleſſedneſs, that is, juſtification, belongs to the circumciſion, that is, to the Jews onely; or to the uncircumciſion alſo; that is, to the Gentiles yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed? <hi>Metonymia adjuncti frequens,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. the ſupply of the Verb; whether it be <hi>(falleth),</hi> as <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact;</hi> or <hi>(cometh)</hi> as our Engliſh: or <hi>(is)</hi> as others; we have no cauſe to enquire of; the ſenſe being apparently ſuch as we have ſhewn.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the doubt: <hi>For we ſay that faith was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Abraham for righteouſneſs,]</hi> as if he had ſaid, This is <hi>in confeſſo,</hi> that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was reckoned to him to righteouſneſs: Now the queſtion here is, Whether, ſith it is apparent <hi>Abraham</hi> was circumciſed, this bleſſedneſs of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or having faith imputed to righteouſneſs, belong to circumciſion onely, or alſo to the uncircumciſed? The
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105203:42"/>ſolution follows, carried artificially, as this whole paſſage is, in a Rhetoricall Dialogiſme: How was it then imputed? &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, If this be the doubt, ſee in what ſtate <hi>Abraham</hi> was when he received this teſtimony of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and you ſhall find it was long before he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed: For, <hi>this imputation of faith to righteouſneſs,</hi> whereof we treat, was whiles he yet had no child, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2. and the ordinance of circumciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan after this, towards a fourteen years: For, after the promiſe made by God, and the teſtimony of righteouſneſs given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> took he <hi>Hagar</hi> to wife, and of her had <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> being 86 years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.16. and many years after, was given him in charge the ordinance of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the execution thereof fell into the year 99 of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the 13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.24, 25, ſo that by the hiſtory it is clear, he was juſtified long before he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed: and this, as the Apoſtle ſeems to intimate, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his myſterie; the Lord thereby teſtifying, that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not had to circumciſion, but that the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed believing, may alſo be ſharers with <hi>Abraham</hi> in that bleſsing.</p>

               <p>Now, the things here obſervable are theſe. Firſt That very circumſtances of Scripture ſtories, afford often, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall concluſions. A weighty concluſion, that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs to Gentiles; and that which was long contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in the days of the Apoſtle, See <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. And it is determined by a circumſtance in the ſtory: <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified in time of uncircumciſion; therefore juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs not to the circumciſed only. A like caſe we have determined, by like evidence <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. out of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſtory conferred; the bleſſing muſt needs be ours by promiſe, and not by the Law. How is it proved? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in Chriſt 430 years, before the giving of the law in <hi>Sinai,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12, 13 14. The Apoſtle proves this concluſion; that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105203:43"/>was not by the <hi>leviticall Prieſthood.</hi> What is his arguments? becauſe another Prieſt was to ariſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Davids</hi> prophecy, not after the order of <hi>Aaron;</hi> even Chriſt, a Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek:</hi> And, becauſe it might be ſaid, that that other Prieſt, though another, yet might be of <hi>Aarons</hi> order; nay, ſaith the Apoſtle, that appears falſe, by this circumſtance; for, our Lord Chriſt, of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, was of another tribe, <hi>even of the tribe of Judah</hi> unto which tribe, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake nothing concerning Prieſthood. I might be infinite in this kinde, but a taſt ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>And it teacheth us, in our ſtudy, and ſearch of Scripture, not to let paſs the ſmalleſt circumſtance, ſith under it, lye hid Doctrine ſo ſubſtantiall: <hi>For wiſdome we ſhould ſearch,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, as men do for ſilver,</hi> Prov. 2.4. turning up every clod, and almoſt grain of duſt, wherein the leaſt portion of pure metall may ſeem to lye hid. <hi>In ſacris liter is nihil eſt, quod non ingentem theſaurum contineat modò ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorem habeat:</hi> Ruizius, reg. 118. <hi>è</hi> Chryſoſtomo; <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli ſermones, ſyllabae, apices, &amp; puncta in divinis Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, plena ſunt ſenſibus;</hi> Hieron. ad Ephes. 3.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, that we miſtake not; we muſt not forget, that even the Scripture hath its <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: and therefore, it is not ſafe always, to reaſon from order of narration; except by other circumſtances, it be evident, that the narration be to the order of times,</p>
               <p>A Second collection of ſome Interpreters hence, is this: That the grace of juſtification, is not tyed to Sacraments; becauſe it may be had without them: And that was it, (as they think) the Lord would teach us by the time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> circumciſion, and juſtification: that look as the Lord, furniſhing the earth with hearbs, and fruits, before he made ſtarrs, by their heat, or influence, to give them vigour, or raine to yeild them moyſture, would teach us, that they are but Arbitrary Jnſtruments, which he uſeth, <hi>ad Placitum;</hi> So the the Lord giving <hi>Abraham</hi> Teſtimony
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105203:43"/>of righteouſnes, before his circumciſion, would thereby teach us, that his grace may be had, without the Sacraments: The queſtion hath been already treated, ad cap: 2. Let us yet, resume it, that at leaſt Our Judgement may be more manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Neceſſity of Baptiſme (whereof the queſtion chiefly is) may be two ways conceived. Firſt,

               <p>Secondly, It may be thus apprehended; whether it be neceſſary, as a mean of ſalvation? In this alſo we conſent; that it is neceſſary, as a mean of ſalvation: Becauſe, 1.

               <p>What is then the queſtion betwixt us, and Papiſts? It ſtands chiefly about the decree, or manner of neceſſity; namely, whether it be abſolutely neceſſary, <hi>Vt perijſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinùs exiſtimetur, cui ejus obtinendi ademta fucrit facultas?</hi>

               <p>A man would now think the odds is not great betwixt us, and Papiſts, touching this point of neceſſity of Baptiſm; They teaching, as we, that out of caſe of contempt, faith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105203:45"/>and converſion avail to ſalvation without the Sacrament: But, will you hear a Merciles diſtinction? It is true, they ſay, of grown men, inaſmuch as they have faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to ſupply the ſtead of Baptiſm; but yet, for infants, it is their peremptory concluſion; though they be born of believing parents, are not capable of perſonall contempt, yet periſh they, in their originall ſinne, for want of Baptiſm, if they die unbaptiſed; For, they have nothing to ſupply the ſtead of baptiſm? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let them ſhew us, where the Lord hath made the condition of infants, in this reſpect, worſe then that of grown men? 2. Let them prove, that in grown men, faith and converſion, therefore exempts them from condemnation, becauſe they ſupply the ſtead of Baptiſm. 3. What hinders to ſay, that the faith of the parents is available to ſalvation of infants, without ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, as well as with it? In caſe they be baptized, they confeſs with <hi>Bernard,</hi> that through grace it is granted them, to have benefit, by others faith, as they were damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by anothers fault; yea, faith <hi>Bernard,</hi> there is no doubt, but that the ſtain contracted by others, may and ought to be purged alſo by the faith of others: doth the faith of a grown man ſupply the ſtead of baptiſm, out of caſe of contempt, and ſhall not the faith of infants do as much for them? No; For it is ſaid, <hi>Except a man be born again of water, and the holy Ghoſt, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God?</hi> But, I demand, is this underſtood of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, generally belonging to all men? or, muſt it be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to infants onely? If of all, then methinks of grown men alſo: If of infants onely. 1. What meant Chriſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to Nicodemus? was it his purpoſe to teach him, that inaſmuch as he was not baptiſed in his infancie, he could not not enter into the kingdome of God? then ſure, I ſhall not wonder, if Nicodemus conceited a neceſſity, for an old man deſiring to come to Heaven, to return back into his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and be born again. 2. Will they ſay, it muſt have this gloſs by limitation; If a man want baptiſm by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105203:45"/>contempt, and not otherwiſe? Why then ſhould it ſtand in force againſt infants, in their own perſons not capable of contemning, and whoſe parents haſten to it with deſire, but are prevented by neceſſity? alas! poor infants, that you free from contempt in your ſelves, and your parents, muſt to Hell for bare want of baptiſm; and elders, in the ſame want have acceſs to Heaven, ſo they be free from contempt: Can we imagine bare want to be more prejudiall to infants, then to grown men.</p>
               <p>Now, what if it ſhall appear to us, that the place cannot, in that ſtrict manner, be underſtood of baptiſm, but of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? The point I wil labour to clear againſt Papiſts only, comparing it thus expounded, with other of their grounds.</p>
               <p>For ground this I wil lay; That the ſentence of our Saviour had truth at that time, when he had conference with Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, yea long before ever ſince the fall of Adam: 1. For that our Savior blames Nicodemus, for his ignorance in this point, the neceſſity of that which he calls the new birth, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Art thou a maſter of Iſrael and knowſt not theſe things?</hi> Now ſure, if it muſt be underſtood of baptiſm, the ignorance of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance could have been no ſuch blemiſh to Nicodemus, the ordinance being ſo new, and of him, till that day, unheard of. 2. Beſides this, the purpoſe of our Saviour more then ſeems to be this, to exhort Nicodemus to preſent labouring for that, whoſe neceſsitie Chriſt teacheth to be ſo abſolute: Now, ſhall we ſay, that at this time baptiſm was of ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſsitie? hear <hi>Bernard,</hi> He was informed of one that taught, how that ever ſince this ſentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by our Saviour, none could in any wiſe be ſaved, without actuall receiving the viſible Sacrament, or martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in ſtead thereof: Now ſure, ſaith <hi>Bernard,

                  </gap>he day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt: The inference is this; that which Chriſt teacheth Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus to be thus neceſſary, was neceſſary at that time, when he had conference with Nicodemus; Baptiſm was not then ſo neceſſary, Therefore that that Chriſt ſpeaks of is not Baptiſm: And do we think Chriſt taught Nicodemus, that after the time of Pentecoſt, Baptiſm ſhould become thus neceſſary? The ſenſe then muſt be this: Nicodemus, look that thou procure Baptiſm, betwixt this and the next Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt after my death; if then thou want it, there is no hope for thee to enter into the kingdom of Heaven: From thoſe circumſtances of the text, beſides others elſewhere pointed at, it is clear, I think, that the place is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Baptiſm of water, but of that which they call the Baptiſm of the Spirit, that is, of Regeneration: And ſee, whether the reaſon annexed prove not as much Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration neceſſary; for, whatever we have by the firſt birth, is fleſhly, and corrupt: Now, ſhall we ſay, that corruption is removed onely by Baptiſm? or, at leaſt, not without it? <hi>Faith purifieth the heart Acts</hi> 15.9. and ſometimes, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

               <p>I have dwelt, perhaps, too long in this queſtion; yet it repents me not, conſidering how I ſee many, carried away with authority of ſome ancients, incline to this mercileſs errour of Papiſts, ſhutting up all infants that die unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105203:46"/>under condemnation, except (perhaps) ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary work of Gods power exempt them from hel: We were wont to teach, not that Baptiſme gives title to the Covenant; but the Covenant to Baptiſme: ſo we reaſon againſt Anabaptiſts; the <hi>Promiſes are theirs Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>the ſpirit theirs, Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. Gods kingdome theirs; therefore Baptiſme muſt not be denied them: how turn we the argument now? on this manner; They muſt be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that they may come nto the Covenant, and that they may have title to the promiſes of God, and kingdome of heaven. And how ſtand theſe arguments in force, againſt baptiſme of Turkiſh, and other Pagan infants? Nay, if in Baptiſme there be this vertue, to give the baptized title to Gods kingdome, if want of it ſo perillous; mercileſs were we, if we forced it not upon ſuch children. What ſhould we imagine the cauſe of this change of judgement? One, or both of theſe? 1. The authority of ancients. 2. An inconvenience they deſire to prevent in the people: For the firſt of theſe; Let ancients (on Gods name,) have their reverence; but yet, ſhall we be ſo ſworn to their words, that we ſhall ſuffer them to lead us with them into their errours?

               <p>Firſt, That it is none at all, but meer ſuperfluity; ſuch miſcreants abhorre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is ſo abſolute, that bare want excludes from heaven; ſuch cruelty deteſt.</p>

               <p>Now, let us go to that which followeth; <hi>And he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, &amp;c.]</hi> The point here proved, is this, as we have heard; that to believing both Iewes and Gentiles, the bleſſing of juſtification belongs: proved from the firſt branch becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had righteouſneſs, <hi>being yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that to Jews onely it belongs, is next concluded: and to this the paſſage is by a new <hi>Prolepſis;</hi> the objection whereof, as it ſeems, hath theſe two branches: If <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> were juſtified in time of uncircumciſion, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was he circumciſed? The uſe of circumciſion ſeems
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105203:47"/>needleſs; yea, and if becauſe he had it in uncircumciſion, therefore Gentiles are ſharers in it; follows it not, that the circumciſed Jews have no part in that bleſſing? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither of theſe follow; for though he had righteouſneſs, being uncircumciſed; yet he tooke the ſigne of circumciſion, an evidence, that to the circumciſion it belongs alſo: and he took it to be a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith; therefore not unneceſſarily; for it is not vain, that faith ſhould receive confirmation: and if any ſhall further demand a reaſon of both theſe, why he had righteouſneſs before circumciſion; and why, having righteouſneſs, he was after circumciſed? It was for this; That he might be the father of both people believing: This the Context.</p>
               <p>In the words, let theſe particulars be obſerved. 1. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> fact. 2. The object; what he received, <hi>the ſign of circumciſion.</hi> 3.

               <p>Sacraments are ſignes ordained of God to ſeal up unto us the righteouſneſs of faith: Your collection is naught, ſay Papiſts: For, you conclude a generall from a particular: It follows not, that if circumciſion were ſo and ſo to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, that therefore all Sacraments are ſuch, and to all men ſuch? But, it is well anſwered, that what belongs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to all the ſpecies may well enough be attributed to the generall: For, that which all the ſpecies have in common,
<note place="margin">Parcus ad loc.</note> they have from their generall: proceed we therefore, to the explication.</p>
               <p>Touching the name of Sacraments, it is idle to contend; though in ſo many letters, and ſyllables, we have it not in Scripture, yet the thing we have: and, why ſhould we be ſo abhorrent from the word ſo ſignificant, and of ſo long continuance in the Church of God?</p>
               <p>The firſt thing, in the nature of a Sacrament, is this:

Yet, they further diſtinguiſh: of ſignes,
<note place="margin">Scotus, ubi ſuprà.</note> ſome are ſpeculative onely; they are ſuch, as are ordained to no other end, but to ſignifie: ſome are withall practicall which are ordained to effect, and work that which they ſignifie: and of this latter ſort they will have our Sacraments to be.</p>
               <p>Thus farre of the generall nature of Sacraments: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we now towards enquiry of the difference, that we may ſee, what it is, that diſtinguiſheth Sacramentall ſignes, from others.</p>
               <p>Signes then are, all of them, amongſt thoſe things, <hi>quae dicuntur ad aliquid:</hi> Every ſigne is a ſigne of ſomething; and by being a ſigne, leads us to conſider of that, whereto it ſtands in relation: What is it then, that Sacramentall ſignes do ſignifie?</p>
               <p>For better underſtanding; we are to conſider in every Sacramentall ſigne, Two things, as Parts, after a ſort of it, as it is ſuch a ſigne: Firſt, a Subſtance, or Matter. 2. Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about that matter: as, in Circumciſion, the matter was the Foreskinne; The Action thereabouts, The cutting off the Foreskinne: In Baptiſm, the Matter is water; the Sacramentall action, the dipping or ſprinkling of the child, &amp;c. If the queſtion now be, what Sacraments in common ſignifie? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Matter, or Subſtantiall element ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the perſon of Chriſt, or ſomething therein: The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Miniſter, the actions of God the Father, and his Spirit, communicating Chriſt, and his benefits unto us: The Sacramentall actions of the people, their receiving Chriſt, and his benefits.</p>
               <p>The Authour of them comes next to be treated of, as part of the difference, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from other ſignes of mans impoſition: The Authour of them, is God onely. 1. Becauſe, He onely can determine ſignes, to ſuch
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105203:50"/>actuall ſignification. 2. And can alone by them aſſure us of the grace they ſignifie.</p>
               <p>Laſt is, the Uſe, or End of Sacraments; which is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the next words; ſeals of the righteouſneſs of faith: Let us explain the words, and then examine the doubts.</p>
               <p>The office of a ſeal ſtands in four things. 1. Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. Diſtinction. 3. Impreſſion. 4. Confirmation According to which ſeverall uſes of ſeals, the explanation is here diverſly conceived: Some think the Apoſtles metaphor hath reſpect to the firſt office, Concealment; and they thus expound it; Circumciſion ſealed up righteouſneſs, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
<note place="margin">Sasbout ex origine.</note> and cloſed it up for a Time, namely, Till by Chriſts coming in the fleſh, it ſhould be revealed. That dotage needs no confutation.</p>
               <p>Another ſort take it well nigh,
<note place="margin">Stapleton, in Antidoto. Cajetan, ad loc.</note> as Anabaptiſts; and they will have it ſo called, onely becauſe it is a mark of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith, by which men might know, that they had obtained the righteouſneſs of faith; but that office of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (if there be any ſuch) is ſufficiently expreſſed in the former Title when it is called a ſigne.</p>
               <p>Whether, in the third reſpect they are called Seals; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they leave a ſtamp, and impreſſion of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith: that abſurdity I wonder ſome of them fell not up<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>; conſidering, that they teach, they confer grace, by the work done: but, the place it ſelf ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it; becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had this righteouſneſs, before, either he received; or God ordained the ſign of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>It remains then, that in the laſt reſpect, they are called ſeals; becauſe, they are ordained for greater confirmation, and aſſurance given to us of righteouſneſs, promiſed in the Covenant of grace: So <hi>Theophylact,</hi> as <hi>Sasbout</hi> conceives him; a ſeal, whereby God ſealed up righteouſneſs to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and teſtified it to be moſt true, and certain; as we are wont to ſet ſeal to that, which we would teſtifie to be ſure, and firm.</p>
               <p>Now, if any demand, what they ſeal up, or confirm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105203:50"/>us the anſwer is; It is the righteouſneſs of faith; that is, remiſſion of ſins, and that eſteem of righteouſneſs, which the Lord allows to all truly believing: If this be not all they aſſure us of, yet it is the principall other ends being all ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to this; other uſes leſs principall, and dependent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now ſee we what it is that adverſaries except againſt our deſcription of Sacraments, hence collected: Forſooth, they tell us, that we reaſon abſurdly, from one ſpecies, to the whole kinde, affirmatively; thereto hath been already anſwered.</p>
               <p>They limit this uſe of circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> only; and though to (him) it was a ſeal, in this ſence, yet not therefore to others: But, I demand,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de Sacram. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 10.</note> was the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> only, or with his ſeed alſo: or, was circumciſion a ſign of the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, or elſe, to his ſeed alſo. If the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to (all;) if circumciſion was to (all,) a ſign of their being in the Covenant; why not to (all) alſo, a ſeal of righteouſneſs? Forſooth, ſay our adverſaries, one end of <hi>Abrahams</hi> circumciſion was peculiar to <hi>Abraham, as that he ſhould be the father of all believers;</hi> therefore this alſo of being a <hi>ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith? Anſw.</hi> And I wonder, why we may not conclude, by the like reaſon, that to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, it was a ſign of the Covenant? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this end they mention had place in <hi>Abraham</hi> only: But, let us more neerly view the Reaſons: It was <hi>Abrahams</hi> priviledg only, to be the father of all believers, both cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and uncircumciſed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> His priviledg onely, to have circumciſion a ſeal of righteouſneſs: How prove they their conſequence? Forſooth, <hi>Paul</hi> joyns both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore they are of like priviledg? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why may we not ſay, <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> that the neceſſity of the ſign of circumciſion, was alſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> priviledg, becauſe it alſo is joyned to the reſt? But, for more full ſatisfaction; view we the ſcope of the text, which is this; To ſhew that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication belongs to believers of both people: The proof is from a ſign; <hi>Abraham had righteouſneſs</hi> in uncircumciſion;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105203:51"/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Righteouſneſs belongs to the uncircumciſed; For, this was that the Lord myſtically intended to ſignifie, in juſtifying <hi>Abraham</hi> before circumciſion; and in commending circumciſion to him juſtified: But, to what end mentions he that end of circumciſion, ſealing up the righteouſneſs of faith? <hi>Anſw.</hi> To anſwer that which he ſaw might be objected, on this manner: If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore circumciſion, what profit received he by that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It (ſealed) unto him the righteouſneſs of faith: And, ſhall we ſay now, it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> priviledg to be confirmed, in perſwaſion of righteouſneſs? belike then, his poſterity either needed no ſuch confirmation, and ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> priviledg ſhall be, to be the only weakling in faith, that needs means of confirmation; or elſe, his ſeed ſhall lack that help, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had for eſtabliſhment, though the Covenant were equally made with them. It is too tedious, to follow them, in all their diverſions; here therefore, an end of his enquiry, touching the generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and uſe of Sacraments.</p>
               <p>What is it now, that our adverſaries want, in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, that ſerves to expreſs the generall nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? that <hi>pulcherima definitio</hi> of a Sacrament extant in the catechiſme of Trent Councill, and ours, beſides the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymie</hi> of the word righteouſneſs, they can aſſign no difference, but in a term onely: <hi>Sacramentum</hi> (ſay they) <hi>eſt res ſenſibus ſubiecta,

               <p>Where we have to things to conſider. Firſt, What
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105203:51"/>grace they are appointed to work? they anſwer, juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; which (after them) ſtands in the habit of faith, hope, charity. Secondly, How they work it? Not as principall efficients; for, that is peculiar to God: but as inſtruments, as the Maſter of ſentences expreſſeth it:
<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Well, let us yeild them to be <hi>organa;</hi> whether Morall or Phyſicall? It pleaſeth not <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm de ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Sacram. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> that they ſhould be cauſes Morall, though he confeſſe a ſtream of their own Writers run current that way: But they muſt be Phyſicall inſtruments, that is ſuch as properly and by inherent vertue, work, or cauſe juſtification: And if any ask what that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is that God hath put in them to effect this grace? He anſwers, It is nothing but Gods moving or uſing of them to that purpoſe: For by this, that God uſeth the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall action to produce grace, he doth elevate it above the nature, and makes it reach to an effect ſupernaturall.</p>
               <p>Now, I might be long in ſhewing the contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own ſide; ſome making them means, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of grace, <hi>per modum continentiae,</hi> becauſe they contain the grace they ſignifie; ſome by concomitance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. I will propound the ſentence of <hi>Scotus</hi> onely, whom ye ſhall find thus to reſolve; There is not (ſaith he) in Sacraments, <hi>aliqua Cauſalitas activa propriè dicta reſpectu gratiae;</hi> but they are ſaid to be cauſes of grace improperly inaſmuch as the receiving thereof is an immediate diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to grace: <hi>&amp; mox;</hi> For thus hath God diſpoſed and ſet down the order, and hereof he hath certified the Church; that to him that in due manner receives the Sacrament, he will give the effect thereby ſignified. This, I trow, is far from <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit. But let us further examine his concluſion: In all ordinary Phyſical inſtruments, which God uſeth to effect his purpoſes by, there is (beſides Gods uſe of them) a vertue, and power, and fitneſs given them to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105203:52"/>produce what he uſeth them unto; as meat, to nouriſh; clothes, to warm; Sun, to cheriſh the earth &amp;c. and ſhall Sacraments be ordinary Phyſical inſtruments and yet lack this inherent vertue? What Philoſophy, yea or Divinitie, ſo teacheth?</p>
               <p>Beſides this, Sacraments all ſuppoſe thoſe habits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they make juſtifying grace to conſiſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> to be in him that receives them, they muſt have faith or, at leaſt; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, before Sacraments may be applied unto them: and ſhall we think they are elevated by this uſe and motion they ſpeak of, to work what is already wrought?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if they wrought thus Phyſically, as it were poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; methinks, then, every one to whom they are applyed, muſt needs receive their effect unavoidably; and ſo <hi>Simon Magus</hi> muſt receive the grace of the Sacrament, as well as <hi>Simon Peter;</hi> which if it be abſurd, as abſurd it is, to make them Phyſicall inſtruments, or Active cauſes of this grace, which they call juſtifying.</p>
               <p>To conclude this whole queſtion; May it not be granted that Sacraments are inſtruments or means of grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt, yes; but inſtruments morall onely; that is, ſuch as whoſe vertue ſticks not in them; but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where they are duely uſed, God is preſent by covenant to work grace ſupernaturall. So <hi>Scotus, ut ſuprá:</hi> ſo ſome of our Divines.</p>
               <p>Yet more nearly; 1. Conſider what grace they are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work, as means. 2. How they concur to the working of it. The grace they work is; 1. Confirmation in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of juſtification. 2. Care and increaſe of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c. How work they it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Occaſionally onely; <hi>quatenus</hi> they repreſent Gods actions, Chriſts perſon and benefits, our duty &amp;c. by which repreſentations Gods ſpirit worketh in our hearts in theſe or the like diſcourſes: God hath in the Goſpel promiſed remiſſion of ſins to all thoſe that believe in Chriſt; and for further aſſurance hath been pleaſed to ordain Sacraments as it were his ſeals ſet to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105203:52"/>his covenant; wherein I ſee repreſented the death of Chriſt, that procured pardon of ſinns; and in the Miniſters action delivering the Sacrament to me, Gods act in delivering Chriſt and his benefits to me is reſembled. Now, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, that if I bring faith to the uſe of the Sacraments, the things they ſignifie are mine. How then aſſumes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I believe what God in the Goſpel promiſeth what in Sacraments he ſeals unto me: and thence follows as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, my faith confirmed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now, what ſay our Adverſaries to this manner of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments efficacy? Forſooth if in this manner onely they have their efficacy, there ſhall then be no difference betwixt Sacraments of the Old Law, and thoſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Anſw.</hi> What, none at all?

                  </note> Concerning the Sacrament of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, their own Divines confeſs many of them, that it had the ſame effect with Baptiſme; and in the ſame manner, namely, the work wrought. Why may we not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that their Sacraments were one with ours in Uſe, Ends, and Efficacy?</p>
               <p>Forſooth, their Sacraments had no abſolute promiſe of grace, ours have. But before I anſwer their objections, the Reader muſt be entreated to obſerve; that they change the ſtate of the queſtion: For, the queſtion is not betwixt them and us, Whether their Sacraments conferred juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105203:53"/>as ours? For we maintain, that neither confer juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation though both equally confirm it, in manner above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewn. But the queſtion is whether theirs had the ſame efficacy that ours have, to the uſes, and ends whereto they were deſigned. And ſo we affirm; that the ſame promiſes for ſpirituall things, were made to both people, in both Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, and confirmed in both Sacraments. The ſame promiſe that is made to us, was made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yea, firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and firſt to the ſeed of his loins, walking in the ſteps of his faith, <hi>Gen,</hi> 17. How elſe reaſons the Apoſtle from the example of <hi>Abraham?</hi> the promiſe was given <hi>Abraham</hi> through faith; <hi>Ergò,</hi> Its ours through faith and not by the Law, &amp;c. and again, How makes he <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of believers in both people, except that the Covenant was ſtabliſhed in him as the father, for his children of both people?</p>
               <p>But have our Sacraments abſolute promiſe of grace ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying to be conferred by them? then what lets infants, even of hereticks in baptiſme of hereticks, to receive juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? And if juſtification may be had in the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of hereticks, why not alſo ſalvation? We will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be of comfort in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and we will hope for our infants yet that they may go to heaven.</p>

               <p>To omit all other their objections, bewraying too foul ignorance in the matter of the Covenant of grace; their laſt onely I will take notice of: It lies thus; Our Sacraments are ſaid to ſave, to regenerate, to juſtifie; and no ſuch thing is read of theirs in the Scriptures; <hi>Ergò.</hi> They are not equal in efficacy? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many of the places alledged, are to be underſtood of the Baptiſme of the Spirit; as that,

                  </label> Let us now leave a while theſe toileſome controverſies and ſee what uſe of this concluſion redounds to us:
And, it ſhall be the ſame that <hi>Paul</hi> once made to the people of Corinth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. upon this ground: That none of us preſume upon Sacraments, as if they ſealed up impunity to willfull tranſgreſſions; there is no greater vertue in ours, then was in Iewiſh Sacraments: And their Murmurings, Idolatry, Fornication, Tempting of God was ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed even in thoſe that partook Sacraments, the ſame with ours, in ſignification, uſe and efficacy: And, why ſhould any of us adventure the diſpleaſure of God, upon vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the work done of Sacraments? Conſider we, that they are not only obſignations of favour but obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to duty; and ſo bined to dutifull carriage; that they ſeal up pardon of no more ſins, then are repented, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken: It is in this reſpect with Gods pardon, as with like indulgence of Princes to Malefactours; they binde for ever to good behaviour: And, I could wiſh our people thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them. But thus it fares with moſt, through their ignorance; as it is ſaid of the Hart, when he is wounded, he runs to the herbe dittany known, by naturall inſtinct, to be ſoveraign: So our people, when they have wounded their ſouls even to death, with the vileſt abominations; they poſt to Sacraments for medicine, adding to their other ſins, this of profaning Gods ſacred ordinances: By the law of God given to the Iewes, it was ordained, that none that had contracted any legall pollution, ſhould on pain of death adventure on their Paſſeover, till ſuch time as his cleanſing, according to the law was accompliſhed: The ſtatute for the letter, bindes not us; but the ſignification thus far ſerves to inſtruct us, that none of us renewing his ſins ſhould adventure on Sacraments, without renewing repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:105203:54"/>
The laſt thing here obſervable, is this; That Sacraments are ordained, not to confer juſtification; but to confirm us in perſwaſion of it: As, to <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſion gave not righteouſneſs, but as a ſeal confirmed it unto him; for what? ſhall we ſay, as Papiſts, This Sacrament was ſo to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, as his priviledg, not ſo ours, to us? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath already been anſwered; and the caſe is as plain for Baptiſme in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as this for circumciſion in <hi>Abraham:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And father of circumciſion</hi>] That is, of Jews circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: <hi>To them, &amp;c.</hi>] that is, to as many as unto circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion added imitation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.</p>
               <p>So then circumciſion alone while it ſtood in force as a Sacrament, made no man a child of <hi>Abraham;</hi> they muſt as well imitate his faith, as admit circumciſion, that would be indeed and truth of that ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the Covenant belonged: Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were of three ſorts; ſome ſuch by propagation onely, ſo Iſraelites, yea Iſhmaelites, are all his children: ſome by imitation onely, as Gentiles, that deſcended not out of his loyns: ſome both by propagation and imitation, as believing Jews. Now here let it be obſerved, that faith is the predominant, and that that hath chief virtue, in making children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> ſuch I mean as to whom the Covenant belonged; inſomuch, that faith ſevered from circumciſion, made chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham;</hi> circumciſion ſevered from faith not ſo.

               <p>And why may we not ſo ſay of Baptiſme, the Sacrament of the New Teſtament? Hath it more virtue to bring us into the Covenant, then had Circumciſion? <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, Mar.</hi> 16.16. he that believes not, ſhall be damned, yea though he be baptized. Why then do Papiſts obtrude upon us the work done of our Sacraments, as if it had ſuch virtue to make us ſharers in the Covenant of grace? they will never be able to prove unto us a diſparity in this kind, betwixt old and new Sacraments. <hi>Indeed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter Baptiſme ſaves;</hi> but it is not the element, but the interrogation of a good conſcience, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. And let me here once again adviſe our people, to adde to that they call their Chriſtendome, faith unfeigned, as they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105203:58"/>deſire to become Chriſtians indeed; and to ſhare with Chriſt in his benefits conveyed unto us in the Covenant of grace. They erre dangerouſly to their ſouls peril, that think the naked Sacrament makes them Gods confederates: To us indeed, the baptized are ſuch till they diſcover hypocriſie; to God, none elſe but hearty believers. Now in deſcribing the circumciſed ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that are ſuch not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation onely, or participation of the Sacrament, but by imitation; the phraſe of the Apoſtle is to be obſerved: They are ſaid to walk in the ſteps of his faith; A Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor expreſsing the exacteſt kind of imitation. Not much unlike is that, that <hi>Job</hi> hath, expreſsing his preciſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate obedienee; <hi>Job</hi> 23.11. <hi>My foot hath held his ſteps.</hi> So accurate would the Lord have us, in imitating the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous examples of his Saints: But of this point of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the cautions and limits thereof, more hereafter on another occaſion. Here it ſhall ſuffice to obſerve, that whoſo will ſhare with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the bleſsing of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, muſt imitate <hi>Abraham</hi> in the condition of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; Believe as he believed, and as near as may be, tread in the ſteps of his faith: Needs proof? ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. and conſider, that the conveyance of all bleſſings is made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, on even terms: From hence is it, that in the next verſe the Apoſtle takes it for granted, that as the promiſe is one made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; ſo the condition is one, required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed. Onely let it be remembred, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> meaſure is not required of all; ſo we follow him in faith, though we keep not pace, we have intereſt in his bleſsing; provided alwayes, we ſtrive to equal, yea to excell him, albeit through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we reach not his perfection.</p>
               <p>This point, had it been well underſtood, or conſidered of ancient Jews, they had not periſhed ſo many, through vain confidence in their carnall deſcent from <hi>Abraham;</hi> but ſo beſotted were they in that preſumption, that they thought very birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> to give them title to his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105203:58"/>bleſſings; what more frequent in the mouths of the moſt incredulous, then this, <hi>We have Abraham to our father? Joh.</hi> 8.36, 39. <hi>We be Abrahams ſeed; Abraham is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But our Saviour well diſtinguiſheth, They were his ſeed by generation; not his ſeed by imitation: If they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, they would do the works of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but now they ſeek to kill Chriſt, thus did not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And I know not how that Jewiſh errour hath place in many of our people; that think they have enough even to ſalvation, that they proceeded from the loyns of virtuous Parents. A bleſſing, I confeſs, not to be diſpiſed; and ſuch an one, as in temporall favours, brings a ſhare often, even to graceleſs children: But what advantage in ſpirituall things a religious parent brings to degenerating poſterity, I conceive not; except, perhaps, the heavier condemnation, Read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. And of this period thus far. Proceed we in the Text.</p>

               <p>THe Apoſtle having now ſufficiently cleared the doubt, moved touching the perſons to whom this bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; returns now from that digreſsion to his principall purpoſe, propounding new arguments to confirm his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. His return is very artificiall, and ſuch as matcheth the skill of the chiefeſt Rhetoricians; the cloſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion reſcuing, after a ſort, the concluſion from which he had digreſſed. His paſſage thus conceive; Deſcribing the Jews, to whom he extends the bleſſing of juſtification, he will have them thus qualified; That they walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith: And marvell not, ſaith the Apoſtle,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105203:59"/>that I interpoſe that condition: <hi>For the promiſe was not to Abraham, or to his ſeed, by the Law, but by the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This third argument therefore, is in ſumme this; Look <hi>(as)</hi> the bleſsing was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>(ſo)</hi> it muſt be obtained; But it was promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c. not through the Law, but through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith; <hi>Ergò,</hi> it muſt be ſo obtained.</p>

for that act of Gods mercy binding himſelf by promiſe, to give <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> this bleſſing; or Meconimically, for the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is the queſtion: The firſt acception ſeems moſt perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as well for the ſcope of the text, as for that we read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he ſhould be heir of the world</hi>] The doubts here are many: 1. What is here meant by the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> being heir thereof? 2. Where we find this promiſe made unto <hi>Abraham?</hi> 3. How it fits the purpoſe of the Apoſtle?</p>
               <p>For the firſt;
<note place="margin">Beza, Paraeus, &amp; alii</note> Moſt Interpreters here underſtand by the <hi>World</hi> that <hi>Mundus credentium;</hi> whereof, 1. <hi>John</hi> 2.2 and by his being heir thereof, his fatherly dominion, and title he had to them by Covenant. But then the queſtion is, How this belongs to his ſeed? for howſoever ſuch dominion was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and he by Covenant was to become Father of many nations; yet to his poſterity was no ſuch promiſe made. Now the promiſe here mentioned, extends it ſelf to his ſeed alſo. If any ſhall ſay, that by the ſeed we are here, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. to underſtand Chriſt; the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Text ſeem not to bear it: for, ſhall we ſay, the promiſe was made to Chriſt by the righteouſneſs of faith? ſurely it appears, his title that he hath to the world as Mediatour, comes to him as a reward of his Legall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. and beſides, the confirmation added, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. ſeems to force us, by the ſeed, to underſtand <hi>Abrahams</hi> other poſterity; except perhaps we ſhall ſay that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105203:59"/>intends to ſhew, not ſo much what condition the Lord required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Chriſt (his chief ſeed) to the end they might be heirs of all the world; as the means by which he intended to ſet them in poſſeſſion of that inheritance; which was not by the Law, but by the righteouſneſs of faith: and that indeed is a truth, and affords accommodation of the reaſons ſubjoyned fit enough: <hi>Judicent docti.</hi> Others by the <hi>world</hi> underſtand, by <hi>Metalepſis,</hi> the Kingdome of Heaven, figured (they ſay) by <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the principall part of the world; and that was, as they ſay truly,

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> a type of heaven. But where find we in all the Scripture, the word <hi>(world)</hi> ſo uſed?</p>
               <p>To the ſecond doubt, Where this promiſe is extant in Scripture? They that by the <hi>(world)</hi> underſtand Believers of all nations, alledge that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17, 18. <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtarres of heaven, &amp;c.</hi> that for the promiſe to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and for Chriſt his ſeed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that by the (world) underſtand <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that which it Typically ſhadowed, produce theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.7. and 15, 8.8. The firſt concerns his ſeed; the ſecond, <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf. To the third queſtion, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accommodation to the Apoſtles purpoſe; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits are divers; the drift is diverſly conceived: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſome imagine this; That <hi>Abraham</hi> is father of nations, not by circumciſion, but by faith: To this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the accommodation is plain.</p>
               <p>The promiſe, <hi>That he ſhould be heir of the world</hi> was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He is father of them in reſpect of faith; not of circumciſion, or the law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the promiſe that makes him heir: Look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how the promiſe is made, ſo <hi>Abraham hath his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The concluſion ſeems this rather; That to believers the bleſſing of righteouſneſs belongs, in reſpect of faith: How followes that from the Apoſtles proof? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance

               <p>The concluſion I think is this; That juſtification belongs to believers, all, and only, in reſpect not of works, but of faith. The Reaſons proving it, is taken partly from the form, or manner of conveiance in the promiſe; partly from parity: In this form; If the promiſe of inheritance to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, was to be accompliſhed, not by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall obedience, but by righteouſneſs of faith; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that we are juſtified by faith, and not by works: But the promiſe of the inheritance to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was to be accompliſhed, not by the law, but by the righteouſneſs of faith: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The conſequence of the propoſition hath this ground, becauſe that juſtification muſt be by ſuch means, as the inheritance may be obtained; and, that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſo as it is promiſed; it is promiſed to be obtained, by the righteouſneſs of faith, as a mean, or diſpoſition thereto tending: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Juſtification is by faith, and not by the law: Hitherto the Connexion.</p>

                  </gap>) ſignifies a promiſe meerly voluntary, and gratuitous; without reſpect to any worth in the party, to whom it is made: In which reſpect, it ſeems to be oppoſed to the law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>From whence it well follows in <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity, that it is not founded on the worth of any our works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. neither may we claim them, as due to us for the merit of our obedience: And, howſoever obedience be required as a qualification of our perſons, to make us capable thereof; yet, the cauſe moving God to beſtow them, is not our righteouſneſs, but Gods promiſe. Memorable is that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat <hi>Moſes</hi> gives to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being now at the skirts of <hi>Canaan; ſay not in thy heart, &amp;c. for my righteouſneſs,

Finally, our wants in this kinde, are uſually chaſtiſements of particular diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From whence followes, as a juſt conſectary, this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; That Gods Children are the richeſt heirs in the world, being by promiſe, heirs of the whole world, and of all the comforts, earth, or heaven can afford them: And ſhould it not teach us, to labour to come within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace? Queſtionleſs, it is true, that though in civill ſtates, men aliens from the Covenants of promiſe, have by humane right a dominion, and property in the things they enjoy; yet, in reſpect of ſpirituall, and true intereſt, they are but uſurpers: the air they breath in, the earth they tread on, the heavens they look on, the meat they eate, the cloaths they are cloathed withall, are not theirs; much leſs the comforts of a better life: For the promiſe, whereon ſuch right is founded, belongs only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing remains, and that is the means whereby the promiſe was intended to be accompliſhed; <hi>Not by the law, &amp;c. but by the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi>

Not by the Law? may ſome men ſay; though to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the promiſe was given, through faith, yet to his ſeed, it was made by the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Made it might be to his ſeed, by the law hypothetically; but the exhibition and performance, was neither accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor yet intended to be accompliſhed ſave only by the righteouſneſs of faith: And yet was not the law vainly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; there being ſo many other ends to which the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Sinai</hi> tended, as the Apoſtle afterwards, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. fully ſhewes.</p>
               <p>Now, from the manner of the Apoſtles reaſoning, we learn, ſo to exſpect the bleſſings promiſed, as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and intended to be performed: God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, to be heirs of the world; the means whereby that promiſe was intended to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was not by the law, <hi>but by the righteouſneſs of faith;</hi> by faith therefore, and not by works, muſt we exſpect the enjoying of them: and of all our hopes of things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, this muſt be the meaſure: By what means, In what manner, In what meaſure they are promiſed, ſo to exſpect the bleſſings: For example, he hath promiſed to godlineſs all the good bleſſings of the earth; but how hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it? with limitation to experiency; with exception of the croſs: Disjunctively, either the bleſſings, or, the equivalent, &amp;c. He hath promiſed victory to us in the ſpirituall combate; but it is neither perfect victory, nor without condition of ſtriving lawfully; nor ſo, but that for our humiliation, and to teach us compaſſion, he may leave us to our ſelves, and permit us to foyls in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: <hi>Sic de reliquis</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The due meditation whereof ſerves to ſupport Gods truth in his promiſe, and our hopes of enjoying the bleſſings promiſed; both which, our ignorance often makes to waver, becauſe of our miſpriſions: the Matter of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe we look at; the Manner how it is made we ſeldome conſider: For example, <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> we ſay, <hi>hath the promiſe

               <p>And want of this Prudence, in weighing the manner, how the promiſes are conveyed, alas! how many inconveniencies hath it drawn Gods great ſervants unto? Abraham had a promiſe of a ſeed to come out of his loins, intended by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah; becauſe the time is delayed, and naturall vigour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth, Sarah begins to diſtinguiſh; ſhe ſhall obtain chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by her maid, it may be; and ſo Abraham goes in to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, to have the promiſe haſtened; Rebecca had learnt from Gods mouth, that Jacob was the Beloved, and the bleſſing ſhould be derived from him to his brother Eſau; but ſee, how ſhe betakes her ſelf to ſhifts of her own, that Gods intentions may take place, &amp;c. the like in ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, might be inſtanced: Learn we to exſpect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, by means, in manner, meaſure, time, that God hath been pleaſed to limit them withall.</p>
               <p>A more particular obſervation out of the Text, is this; That the inheritance promiſed to Abraham, and his ſeed, was never intended to be exhibited to them, through the righteouſneſs of the Law, as a mean, whereby they ſhould obtain it: What needs much confirmation? the concluſion being the Apoſtles, almoſt in ſo many words; and reaſons by him annexed to that purpoſe: Had God a purpoſe, by the Law to make us partakers of the Inheritance; What meant he then to ſubſtitute another mean? namely, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith: Perhaps ſome ſhould obtain it by the Law; others, by faith? How abſurd is that conceit? when as the Apoſtle hath taught us, that God is unvariable in his courſes in this kind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. and, can we think the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity obtained it, by any other mean then Abraham the root of bleſſing? Either therefore, God intended not unto
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105203:63"/>us the inheritance, by the Law; or elſe, vain was the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of faith: Hereto let us add this conſideration, That no man ever yet obtained it, by the righteouſneſs of the Law; and can we better judge of Gods intentions, then by the event? Beſides, How was it, that the Lord creating A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in the perfection of righteouſneſs, wittingly permitted his fall; if he had meant to give us the inheritance, by the Law? ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. And, wherefore is it, that having power to enable us to perfect performance of the Law, He never yet ſupplyed any of his Saints with perfection of ſtrength to fulfill it? Certes, if by Legall righteouſneſs he intended for us the inheritance; that righteouſneſs ſhould be at leaſt by Grace given unto us: But it is given to none. If any ſhall now demand, why the Law was given, except to be a mean of the inheritance? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let him hear the Apoſtle: <hi>To ſhew us our ſinne, Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>To beat down pride, to drive unto Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.24. And if to any it be propounded as a mean of life; I dare ſay, it is to a proud Juſtitiary, to the end to humble him, and to drive him through conſcience of infirmity, from confidence in works, to believing in Chriſt for righteouſneſs.</p>

If they which are of the Law, be heirs, then is faith made void, and the promiſe of none effect: But neither is faith void, nor the promiſe of none effect: <hi>Ergò,</hi> They which are of the Law, be not heirs; or which is equivalent, the promiſe of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not obtained by the Law.</p>

But the other Expoſitions ſeem more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: let us view them: <hi>Faith is vain]</hi> That is, ſay ſome fruſtrate and fruitleſs, though how, they explain not; perhaps they thus conceive it; If they onely which fulfill the Law be heirs then faith is fruitleſs, and can never attain the inheritance promiſed; inaſmuch as no man is able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law.</p>
               <p>But, I take it, the Apoſtle hath eye rather to the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of faith on Gods part, then to the fruit on ours: So that the ſenſe is this; If they which ſeek the inheritance by the Law, do by the Law obtain it; needleſly and vainly was faith preſcribed to be the means of inheritance.</p>
               <p>To diſcern the conſequence of this argument, view we whereupon the neceſsity of ſubſtituting faith inſtead of works grew.</p>
               <p>The Lord had made a covenant of life with man, upon condition of fulfilling the Law; ſo that if he kept the Law, and continued in obedience thereof, he ſhould live: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. Man falling through diſobedience, loſt the benefit of that Covenant and withall propagated to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity a nature, ſo not onely impotent to fulfill the Law; but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105203:65"/>vitiouſly inclined to the breach thereof, that there was no hope of ſalvation, by the Law. Howbeit, the Lord out of his love to mankind, and loath that the whole poſterity ſhould periſh, in his rich mercy was pleaſed to enter a new covenant of life and ſalvation, eſtabliſhing another means for our happineſs which was faith of the Meſsiah, by which through grace, performed, we might from Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a better, and more firm title to the inheritance. This was one reaſon, why faith was preſcribed; as is intimated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Now, how needleſs had this been, if by the Law we might inherit ſalvation? To what end go we, by faith, out of our ſelves, to ſeek righteouſneſs and ſalvation in Chriſt; if by the Law performed by our ſelves, we might have obtained it? The Conſequence therefore we ſee to be firm.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider, what out of this argument may be collected: <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </label> The Doctrine of ſalvation by works, fruſtrates faith,
and chargeth on God the crime of folly, in ordeining it to be the onely mean of inheritance. Much to this purpoſe ſpeaks the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, &amp;c. <hi>If righteouſneſs be by the Law, then Chriſt died in vain;</hi> it had been needleſs for the Lord to ſend his Son to die for our ſins, thereby to procure unto us juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if by the Law we might have obtained the bleſsing: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. he makes this his reaſon, why the Lord ſent his Son, <hi>in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh;</hi> becauſe <hi>it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Law,</hi> weakned by the fleſh, <hi>to give us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto, what ſay our adverſaries? Forſooth, their old diſtinctions they obtrude for anſwer: Works are of two ſorts; ſome done by ſtrength of naturall free-will; ſome by grace and faith: works of naturall free-will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed fruſtrate faith, and grace, and Chriſts death; not ſo works done by grace in faith: yea, the Apoſtles conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. is very firm, if by them we will exclude works done through grace: For, it followes not, that if
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105203:66"/>we be juſtified by works following faith, that then Chriſt dyed in vain;

That our ſervices are acceptable to God, by Ieſus Chriſt; that our works done in faith are pleaſing to him, though in great weakneſs performed, we finde: that they are of value to countervail our ſins, or to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Heaven, we finde not: nay, the contrary we finde in ſundry Scriptures taught us. 2. Yea, the purgation of our ſins, we know Chriſt made by (himſelf,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and the way into the holy of holies to be opened, by his fleſh, never by our righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. 3. Let the Reader obſerve, how cleanly a gull they would put upon us, in this diſtinction of works done by grace, and thoſe done by power of naturall free will: For, in theſe works of grace, free-will is, according to their principles, the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant. 4. Doth the Law of God in any place, allow us juſtification, by works imperfect, though done in grace? ſearch, and ſee, whether it damne not to hell the leaſt blemiſes cleaving to our works; and require, not only that the principall manner, and end, be regular, but that in every reſpect, they be pure and free from blemiſh: All which conſidered, return us our concluſion firm, and undoubtfull; notwithſtanding theſe cavills of popiſh Iuſtitiaries. In our paſſage, let us take notice of the intolerable pride of our merit-mongers, chuſing rather to robbe God of the glory of his wiſdome, then in humility, to acknowledg the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of their own obedience: How much better were it, with holy <hi>Iob</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond inconvenience follows to be ſcanned: The promiſe by this means, becomes ineffectuall; How, if any demand? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe, the inheritance promiſed, ſhall never by this means be obtained: For hangs it on condition of fulfilling the law?

I take to be the ground of the conſequence; the rather, for the reaſons objoyned.</p>
               <p>Hence the inference is fluent; That who ſo teacheth us to ſeek ſalvation by works, fruſtrates Gods promiſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of ſalvation: Not but that good works are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but as duties, not as merits; for thankfulneſs, not for righteouſneſs; as the way to the kingdome, not as cauſes of ſalvation; <hi>the ſon of the bondwoman, ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the freewoman, Gal.</hi> 4.30.

               <p>Hear the Reaſons: They bind us, by this means, to a condition, and means of Salvation, impoſſible not onely to Nature, but to Grace, according to that portion, God is pleaſed, in this life, to proportion to us; that is, the fulfilling of the whole Law; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. our Saviour to ſuch a boaſter, asking, <hi>What he muſt do to inherit ſalvation,</hi> ſuits anſwer to his proud humour; <hi>Thou knoweſt the Commandments;</hi> if doing be the means thou ſeekeſt to inherit by, <hi>Keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> this do, if thou wilt needs be doing, and thou ſhalt live; fail in the leaſt <hi>apex,</hi> the Curſe is upon thee, <hi>Gal</hi>

is the promiſe of none effect, that is, ſalvation promiſed can never be obtained: How follows the argument? The Apoſtle ſhews us, by ſending us to conſider the effect, or work of the Law, ſuch as it hath in all men, ſince the fall: The Law cauſeth wrath: <hi>Ergò,</hi> it fruſtrates the promiſe to all that cleave thereto for juſtification: And this Antecedent hath proof from another effect of the Law, betwixt which, and wrath, the connexion is inſeparable, to wit, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it cauſeth tranſgreſſion; <hi>Ergò,</hi> wrath.

                  </label> For the ſenſe, view we a little the particulars:
they are principally two. 1. The effect of the Law. 2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how it produceth his effect.</p>
               <p>The effect of the Law is wrath; whether Gods, or mans? Mans, ſaith <hi>Sasbout,</hi> alledging to that purpoſe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> neither diſſent ſome of our own Divines.
<note place="margin">Illyricus.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And if any ask How? They anſwer, by urging things upon the conſcience as duties, from which our vitious nature is moſt abhorrent; as alſo, by ſhewing how odious all a mans beſt actions, yea his whole nature is; and adjudging him to hel for his ſins: againſt thoſe acts of the Law, how doth mans vitious and proud nature ſtorm? that not without cauſe have learned interpreters thus expounded.</p>
               <p>But fitlier to the Apoſtles purpoſe, it is expounded of the wrath of God, that is, of the puniſhments which for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, God is in his wrath ready to execute. Now if any demand, How the Law ſhould have this effect? Not of it ſelf, as if it were originally deſtined to ſubject man to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105203:68"/>but by accident, and occaſionally onely in reſpect of our diſobedience; which ſith it is by means of corrupt nature inevitable, as inevitably doth the Law adjudge us to puniſhment, as our vitious nature forceth us to rebellion.</p>
               <p>This is the ſenſe of the firſt clauſe.</p>
               <p>It alſo hath its proof: The Law cauſeth wrath, for it cauſeth trangreſsion, betwixt which and Gods wrath the connexion is inſeparable: How, we ſhall hear by and by; if we ſhall firſt view the manner of the Apoſtles reaſoning. It is thus, as moſt conceive, <hi>A contrario ſenſu:</hi> Where is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion; therefore where the Law is there is transgreſſion. But what if we conceive the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to reaſon <hi>à ſignis;</hi> Where is no Law, there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; an apparent ſigne that is, that by means of the Law transgreſſion followeth: take away the Law, there is no transgreſſion; therefore apparent, that by putting the Law we put transgreſſion.</p>
               <p>See we how; how comes it, that the Law draws with it ſo unavoidably transgreſſion? ſith it forbids, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens diſobedience; enjoyns and crowns obedience? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not of it ſelf; but by accident, through the corruption of nature: <hi>ut ſuprâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In man corrupted, the Law hath a double advantage to further tranſgreſſion: 1. Becauſe by it corruption is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be the more ſinfull; as in men unregenerate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5, 13. 2. Through impotencie and weakneſs that remains in nature even reformed, to perform that obedience which the Law requires, in that manner it requires it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p>Some other explanations might be annexed, as this; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin is therefore ſin, becauſe it violates ſome Law; take away all Law, thou takeſt away all ſin; for ſin eſſentially preſuppoſeth ſome preſcription of Law violated.

                  </label> The point then obſervable is this;
That the law is ſo far from reſtoring us to Gods favour that it occaſioneth his wrath; ſo far from juſtifying, that it condemns; ſo far from being means of righteouſneſs, that it occaſioneth tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hence called the Miniſtry of condemnation, and death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. and the very ſtrength and vigour of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 56. That not without cauſe, ſaid <hi>Luther</hi> though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore traduced by Papiſts; the law alwayes accuſeth, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, condemneth: The ſeverall branches will be evident if we ſhall clear the laſt only; and ſhew, how inevitably it draws after it tranſgreſſion in all the poſterity of <hi>Adam:</hi> That maſs, let us conceive, to admit this diſtinction; part of it is meerly naturall, ſuch only as it is derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> part ſanctified, and purged in a meaſure by the Holy Ghoſt: For that meerly naturall, it is confeſſed by adverſaries, it is ſo meerly rebellious againſt the law, that the more it is reſtrained, the more it rebells: things prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited therefore the more affected, becauſe prohibited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. &amp; 8. The main queſtion is, touching thoſe of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, that are by grace renewed; whether in theſe alſo the law puts a neceſſity of tranſgreſſing? Now, howſoever we acknowledg, that grace ſo far prevails againſt nature, that there is ſomething in every man rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ſo far from fretting againſt the law, that it findes a kinde of <hi>complacentia,</hi> and delight in the laws preſcripts <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. Yet, 1. Neither are we ſo wholly purged by grace; but that there ſtill remains in us, part of that carnall wiſdome, that is not nor can be ſubject to the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>There ſtill is a law in the members, rebelling againſt the law of the minde Rom.</hi> 7.23. And, 2. Though it were granted, we are wholly freed from enmity to the law, yet are we not wholly delivered from frailty in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; in which laſt reſpect at leaſt, ſinning even in men regenerate, is occaſioned by the law inevitably, in reſpect
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105203:69"/>of the event: Let us yield then, <hi>ex abuntdnti,</hi> that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is not in Gods Children cauſed, <hi>ex fremitu;</hi> yet (I hope) it is occaſioned, <hi>ex infirmitate,</hi> by frailty: And though Gods Children ſin not, out of fury; yet ſin they out of impotency: Beſides the texts now alledged, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare we the perfection of the righteouſneſs, which the law requires, with the perfection of that holineſs grace wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; and we ſhall not chuſe but acknowledg, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of another principall; yet ſin is by the law occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned infallably, in the Children of God ſo long as they live here, in the ſpirituall warfare; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>For clearing of this point, ſith thereon turns the whole controverſie: It ſhall not be amiſs to handle that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie: Whether the righteouſneſs performed in the law to juſtification, fall within compaſs of our power to perform, ſo long as we live in this world? Or, whether all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the law, may be, by any ſtrength of grace here attained, avoided? In this queſtion, the opinions are three. Firſt, That of Pelagians, condemned long ſince, to the pit of hell: The law they ſay, is poſſible to nature; If a man would ſtrive with his naturall abilities to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, he might perfectly fulfill the law, without any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of grace ſupernaturall: And, the only reaſon, why men fail in legall obedience, is, becauſe they want will: Touching this, though I refer the Reader to what was long ago written pithylie, and truly, by S. <hi>Auguſtine, Hierome,</hi> and others: only remember we, what <hi>Paul,</hi> that had more then nature, profeſſeth of himſelf; <hi>To will is preſent,</hi> but I finde <hi>not power to perform, Rom.</hi> 7.18. He failed in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; not for that he wanted will, but becauſe he lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrength: And leaſt any ſhould think it was his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weakneſs; he ſhewes the ſame impotency to be in all Gods Children, even after regeneration, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S. Auguſt. de peccat. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. &amp; Remiſſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> ex abundanti,</hi> yields to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that we may keep the law, <hi>ſi volumus;</hi> but the Hypotheſis, ſaith he, is impoſſible; We cannot (will) to make good the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105203:69"/>of the law: His reaſons are; becauſe impediments unavoidable the will hath alwayes clogging it, in this life; 1. Ignorance. 2. Infirmity: And ſometimes our wills are not moved to do what the law preſcribes; <hi>quia latet quod juſtum eſt;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>quia minus delectat:</hi> From both theſe who can ſay, he is, or can be free, during ſtate of this life?</p>
               <p>Second opinion is that of Papiſts; The Law is poſſible, yea eaſie, though not to Nature, yet to Grace: and <hi>anatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> to him, that ſhall ſay, the Commandments of God are impoſſible to a man, in ſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p>The judgement of our Churches ſtands thus: obedience to the Law is thus diſtinguiſhed; there is an inchoate obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſtanding. 1. In love of the Law. 2. Deſire. 3. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 4. Endeavour to obey. 5. Some meaſure of actuall performance. 6. Grief for imperfections: this is poſſible to every regenerate child of God.</p>
               <p>There is alſo perfect, and complete obedience, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers exactly to the rigour of the Law, for matter, manner, meaſure of performance: of this is the queſtion; and hereof teach we, that by no meaſure of grace here given, it can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be attained.</p>
               <p>See we therefore the terms. 1. What that obedience is, which the Law requires. 2. What meaſure of grace it is, that God, in this life, gives to his children.</p>
               <p>The juſtice of the law, in <hi>Bernards</hi> terms, muſt thus be qualified. 1. It muſt be <hi>Recta,</hi> according to rule, ſo that all that is preſcribed, and onely what is preſcribed, muſt be done. 2. It muſt be <hi>Pura,</hi> free from blemiſh in manner and meaſure of performance. 3. <hi>Firma,</hi> ſteady for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, without any the leaſt intermiſſion, and interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And this explanation hath ground, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Where, the law curſeth to hell every man that continues not in all things, written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hieroms</hi> term, ſomewhat unuſuall, but ſignificant, the law requires to righteouſneſs, <hi>Impeccantiam,</hi> that is, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                  </gap>, <hi>Infirmity;</hi> and that explanation hath ground, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. becauſe the wages of every ſinne, more or leſs, is death. According to the Apoſtles explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The righteouſneſs of the law muſt be 1. Univerſall <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. ſo that no duty, nor branch of duty, in any Commandment, may be omitted; No ſinne, nor degree of ſin, againſt any precept, may be incurred. 2. As the law is ſpirituall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. ſo preſcribes it ſpirituall obedience; not onely binding the outward man to good behaviour; but reaching to the very thoughts, and affections, and ordering them; ſo that, though it were poſſible for a man, to omit no outward act of duty enjoyned; to incurre no outward act of ſin forbidden; yet evil purpoſes, deſires, yea thoughts of evil approved; yea, if they ariſe from that inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Concupiſcence, unapproved, diſable us from being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Law: For, the tenour thereof runs thus, Love the Lord with all thy ſoul, with all thy thought, &amp;c. This meaſure of obedience we teach,

                  </note> not onely as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that it never yet fell into any man, in this life, nor, in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſhall be attained; but that it is impoſſible, to be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto: That that term offend not, know we, that though all things are poſſible unto God, nothing hard unto Him; yet that infinite, and boundleſs power of God admits a double limit. 1. His nature; hence ſaid the Apoſtle, God cannot lie, and, it is impoſſible, that God ſhould lie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. or denie himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. Theſe, and the like defects being ſo repugnant to his nature, that if they were incident into Him, he might ceaſe to be God. 2. Beſides his nature, his will, and ordinance further reſtrains his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in reſpect of the executions thereof; whereby it comes to paſs, that of many things agreeing well with his nature; yet, ſuppoſing his peremptory ordinance, and decree to the contrary; we may ſay, They are impoſſible: For example, It was poſſible for God to have ſaved his children, by ſome other means, then the death of his ſonne; but ſuppoſing his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105203:70"/>ordinance, determining this; we ſay, without blaſphemy, it is impoſſible, that any ſhould be ſaved by any other mean, then the death of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. So, though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it had been poſsible for the Lord, to have given his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Grace, fully proportionate to the obedience of the Law; yet conſidering his Will to the contrary, we ſay, it is impoſsible, that by meaſure of grace here given, to make good perfection of legal juſtice. That meaſure Paul thus expreſſeth; we have <hi>primitias,</hi> the firſt-fruits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. and <hi>arrham ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus,</hi> The earneſt of the ſpirit only, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.

Corruption ſtil to be mortified, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. In a word, Grace ſuch, as that when we have attained to the greateſt meaſure appointed to this life, and ſtretched our gracious abilities to the utmoſt, hath need of mercy to cover imperfections; and pardon, to clear from guilt contracted.</p>
               <p>Let us now out of theſe grounds, aſſume; And firſt, out of <hi>Bernards Requiſites:</hi> Can any poſsibly ſay, His actions are all ſo regular, that in none of them, there is want of that recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, required in the law? whoſe meaſure of illumination is ſo great, as to comprehend that depth of righteouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law? Certainly David, a man of a Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpirit, prays for pardon of ſecret ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. and ſtill finds need of further Revelation to know the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things of the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. And Pauls profeſsion is, <hi>That we know in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</p>
               <p>But yield a man may know all enjoyned, and do all he knows; can any ſay, His performances are without blemiſh? ſo that no imperfection cleaves to any of his actions? ſaith <hi>Bernard, Noſtra, ſi qua eſt, humilis juſtitia; Recta forſitan, ſed non Pura;</hi> Except, happily we are better then our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe humble confeſsion it was, that all their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes were as filthy clouts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. If any ſay, The Prophets ſo ſpeaks in humility? Nay, ſaith <hi>Bernard, Non minùs verè, quam humliter;</hi> in as much truth, as humility;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105203:71"/>ſay Pelagians, He ſpake as the mouth of the people, and as a member of the Body, wherein thoſe blemiſhes were: Hear then that great Daniel,

               <p>But ſuppoſe our performances may be thus univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and free from (blemiſh); is it, or can it be ſo (ſteddy) in any, that it at no time admits interruption?

Auguſtine</hi> anſwers; It is a ſtrange poſsibility, that never yet came into act, no not in thoſe whoſe meaſures of grace were greateſt.

                  </gap>; and by a reaſon irrefragable, ſhews not onely that through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we do not, but that through impotency we cannot do what we would: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. the Apoſtles requiſite is, that our obedience be ſpirituall <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14.

               <p>S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to this purpoſe, mentioning that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. <hi>out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, &amp;c.

                  </label> Let us now ſee a little, how we may uſe this concluſion to our profit: and firſt, I cannot here but take notice of that pride and arrogancy of our vulgar people; then whom, though none be more licentious in life, yet none that arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themſelves greater purity, or perfection of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And howſoever they ſcoff at the very endeavour of purity in others, though with never ſo feeling acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of imperfections; yet, who hath not heard that proud profeſsion from their mouthes; They can love God above all, their neighbour as themſelves: To whom if our Saviour ſhould propound like triall, as to him in the Goſpel, that made like proud profeſsion; I doubt not, but they ſhould diſcover as much hypocriſie. Our Saviour lighting on ſuch a braggard, that had from his youth up kept the Commandments, to make him ſee his pride and hypocriſie, propounds him not as Papiſts ſay, A counſell of Perfection, but a precept of triall: Thou profeſſeſt to love God above all, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf: If that be ſo, ſell all that thou haſt and give to the poore; thou ſhalt have reward in heaven. That precept, to ſuch a meaſure of love, as was profeſſed, was not harſh. But, <hi>He goes away ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing,</hi> ſaith the Text, and thereby bewrayes his proud diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling. Let the triall be far more reaſonable unto our people; Leave but profane paſtimes, unlawfull profits for his ſake you love ſo well: this ſpeech is as harſh to our proud, diſſembling, ſelf-loving people.</p>
               <p>To us all, Let me ſay as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4.21. <hi>You that will needs be under the law,</hi> for juſtification, <hi>do ye not hear the law?</hi> you look for righteouſneſs by the law, it cauſeth tranſgreſſion; for ſalvation, it cauſeth wrath: And is it not ſtrange, men acquainted with Scriptures, ſhould cleave ſo cloſe to the juſtification of the Law. I had once to deal with a Papiſt, in this queſtion, and that of merit: <hi>Menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> if he profeſſed not; that except he thought, he could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105203:73"/>merit righteouſneſs and ſalvation by his works, he would never do any good work: Miſerable man! are there not motives ſtrong enough to obedience, except thou mayeſt thereby be juſtified? Is not that love of God, in ſending his Son to dye for thy ſins, that he might make thee zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works, enforcement ſufficient to all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, except thou mayeſt part ſtakes with Chriſt, in the glory of thy ſalvation? Hear <hi>Paul, The love of Chriſt conſtraineth me to all faithfulneſs in my calling,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14. 2. And is it nothing that by this means, <hi>we make our calling and Election ſure?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 3. Nothing, that others by ſeeing their ſpotleſs converſation, are occaſioned to glorifie God? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. In a word, that nothing might be wanting, to quicken our dulneſs; the Lord hath been pleaſed by promiſe, to binde himſelf, to recompence even of ſlendereſt duties, tendred to him in ſincerity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.41. A reward thou ſhalt have accrewing, not from worth of thy works but from grace of the promiſer: Will not that ſatisfie? Not at all, except they may merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as if they ſhould ſay, they had rather have no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then be beholden to Gods bounty for the beſtowing: The Apoſtle methinks thunders againſt ſuch meritmongers, <hi>They are fallen from grace, and Chriſt ſhall profit them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Gal. 5.4.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Hence learn to deteſt, as greateſt enemies to thy ſalvation, all ſuch as teach to ſeek it, by the law: of ſuch, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> let them be <hi>Anathema; Aut, utinam exſcindan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> Gal. 5.12.</p>
               <p>Of all Hereticall, and falſe Teachers this laſt age hath afforded; I know none more pernicious then theſe two. 1. Libertines, that teach to neglect obedience, as in every reſpect unneceſſary. 2. Juſtitiaries, that preſs obedience, as available to juſtification: The firſt ſort are odious to all, except Epicures: The latter, by how much the more ſtrictly they urge obedience, and that ſo fittingly to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of nature, by ſo much the more pernicious: As much
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105203:74"/>excludes from Heaven, the intention of meritting, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming; as the neglect of the Lawgivers authority, in omitting obedience: Theſe are enemies to the Dominion, The other, profeſſed adverſaries to the grace of God.</p>

Thirdly, And both theſe are intended to all the ſeed. All theſe ſeverall arguments are artifically linked together by the Apoſtle, and as it were entwyned one in another, by mutuall dependance: Let us view them ſeverally. It muſt be by faith that it may be by grace: If the inheritance be ours by grace, and not by debt, then muſt it be by faith; but it is ours by grace; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The force of the conſequence we will ſhew, after we have a little explaned the text.</p>
               <p>The verb, <hi>&amp; ſuppoſitum</hi> are both wanting; It is by faith: What muſt be by faith?

               <p>It were impertinent, perhaps, on this occaſion, to run out into that queſtion; Whether by grace, we are here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the gifts of grace in us, or the favour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us?</p>

                  </label> The point is, that our righteouſneſs,

Let us enquire, whether this can be the ſenſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in aſcribing the inheritance unto Gods grace; or whether his purpoſe be, only to make grace a ſharer with our merits, and not rather ſo to give all to grace, that he excludes all <hi>debitum,</hi> that may accrew to us, in reſpect of our works, See Annotat. ad <hi>cap.</hi> 3.24.</p>
               <p>Freely by grace, that is, meerly by grace, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. So that all boaſting in our ſelves may be excluded. In a word, See, 1.

               <p>The Second point followes; That it may be of grace, it muſt be of faith: This way of juſtification, and no other preſerves the glory of Gods grace entire: Let us ſee how, ſay ſome, becauſe grace is promiſed, and given only to the believer;
<note place="margin">Paraeus ad loc.</note> that is a truth: But the Apoſtles purpoſe in this argument, is not to ſhew the neceſſity of faith, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of grace; but rather to the maintaining of the glory of Gods grace, in the matter of our righteouſneſs, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Let us enquire therefore, how this means of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105203:75"/>by faith ſtabliſheth grace; and how that other by works, either overthrows, or empairs it: May we ſay as ſome of late, becauſe faith is a free gift of God in us? The like may be ſaid of charity: But take faith correlatively, thou ſhalt ſee eaſily, how this means of juſtification alone, and no other, makes grace glorious: For, if all our title to righteouſneſs, and ſalvation accrew to us only, for the obedience ſake of Chriſt, apprehended by faith; who ſees not how entirely the glory of all, belongs to the grace of God?</p>
               <p>But I wonder how Papiſts, with all their skill, can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the concurrence of works, in procuring our title to righteouſneſs, and ſalvation; and not overthrow, or clip, at the leaſt, the glory of Gods grace: Perhaps, becauſe our works proceed of grace: but, <hi>Dic ſodes;</hi> are they meerly of grace? or partly, of the power of nature? Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent is, that though grace be a principall, yet natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall abilities have their partnerſhip in every good work: So much as they aſcribe to nature, ſo much they derogate from the grace of God: See Annotat. ad cap. 3. verſ. 27.

                  </label> The Point is,
That the promiſe of inheritance is firm, and ſhall have certain accompliſhment: Read for this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. where the Apoſtle compares the two covenants together, and ſhews that of grace to be preferred, eſpecially in reſpect of the certainty of it, and of our attainment of the bleſſings therein conveyed: And, view. 1. The Mediatour Chriſt, in whoſe bloud it is ratified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2. The removall of impediments, by mercifull pardon of ſinnes, and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. The certain donation of graces neceſſary to attainment, and our confirmation therein; <hi>ibidem:</hi> the certainty of accompliſhment is eaſily diſcerned.</p>
               <p>The more ſolid is our Hope, and the more firm ſhould be our faith, and confidence, as the Apoſtle inferres, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. So that neither violence of afflictions, nor prevailing of hereſies, nor conſcience of our own weakneſſes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to which pardon is promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. nor any doubt of perſeverance in ſtate of grace, ſhould make us wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</note> For he is faithfull that hath promiſed, not onely ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but pardon of ſinnes, donation of ſpirit, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and perfecting the work of grace to the day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: It is true, there are duties required of us, to the obtaining of the promiſes; as faith, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in faith; obedience, and perſeverance in obedience; but that God that requires them, hath covenanted to work them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and, 32.40.</p>
               <p>The next point is, The neceſſity of faith, and the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105203:78"/>it hath peculiar to it ſelf, in making firm, after a ſort, the promiſe: the truth of this point will the better appear, if we ſhall conſider a little the conſent, and difference of the two Covenants: Their agreement is this; in both is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Salvation, and Bleſſedneſs; of the Law it is ſaid. That if a man do it, he ſhall live thereby; as of faith, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Their difference ſtands. 1. In the condition, the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring perfect obedience to be performed in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; threatning a curſe to every tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. The other Covenant requiring faith of the Meſſiah, and ſincere endeavour of obedience. A ſecond difference; the Law requires perfect obedience; promiſeth neither ability to perform it, nor pardon to any imperfection: The Goſpel ſo requires faith, that it promiſeth to work it; ſo new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that withall, the Lord covenanteth to make us walk in his ſtatutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. Yea, and to pard on imperfections, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. And beſides, delivers all theſe promiſes, as ratified unto us, in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus briefly laid together ſhew, how faith onely makes the promiſe ſure; becauſe, to the believer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made. 1. To remove impediments, by pardon, and ſanctification. 2. To enable to do, and to perſevere in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever the Lord, in the Covenant of grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to ſalvation: Who can ſhew like promiſes made to the Worker? that, not without cauſe, ſaid the Apoſtle. It muſt be of faith, that the promiſe may be (ſure;) it being impoſsible by the Law to obtain the promiſes.</p>
               <p>The third Argument, from the extent of the promiſe, both in the making, and accompliſhment; It is made, and muſt be ſure to (all) the ſeed, not onely to that of the Law, but to that alſo, which is of the faith of Abraham; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it muſt be of faith, and not of the Law: The <hi>minor</hi> hath its proof, in the latter end of the verſe, and is alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed and illuſtrated, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. Abraham is the father of all both Jews, and Gentiles, as it is written;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105203:79"/>Therefore the promiſe muſt be ſure to all the ſeed.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Senſe </seg>
                  </label> That the force of the argument may appear;
See we briefly the ſenſe of the words: The whole ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is here,
<note place="margin">Paraeus.</note> as ſome think, deſcribed by properties; as I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think, diſtributed into kinds: They that think it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, imagine a trajection of the Article, and thus render; To the whole ſeed which is not onely of the Law, but alſo of the faith of Abraham. But againſt this expoſition are theſe reaſons. 1. That by this means the promiſe ſhall be here reſtrained to the Jewiſh ſeed onely; inaſmuch as they onely are that ſeed of the Law; whereas the Apoſtles pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, to include the ſeed of the Gentiles, as appears by the confirmation; <hi>I have made thee a father of many nations.</hi> And, 2. The <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of the argument lying in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall particle is, by this means, much abated: beſides that the Trajection is harſh, and hath no pregnant example in other Scripture, nor warrant from circumſtances of the place to approve it.</p>
               <p>I rather conceive it, as a diſtribution of Abrahams ſeed, brought to illuſtrate, and explain what the Apoſtle meant, By the whole ſeed; as if it had been ſaid, The ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is of two ſorts: One, part of the Law, as the Jews; another, not of the Law, but of the Faith of Abraham, as the Gentiles: To both theſe muſt the promiſe be ſure; which cannot be, if the law be made the condition, or mean of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirtiance.</p>
               <p>What is the ground of the Conſequence? this as I think; becauſe the Law was given to the Jews onely, and not to the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. and 2.14.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then here is, Whether the Law were not given to Gentiles, as well as to Jews? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some here diſtinguiſh on this manner: The law of ordinances, and ceremoniall rites was given onely to Jews: that that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns morall duties, to Gentiles alſo; as who ſay, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpake onely of Ceremonies, and not chiefly of the Law morall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:105203:79"/>
Was not then the Law morall given to the Gentiles? how then binds it us to obedience? <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the morall law, we muſt conſider two things. 1. The ſubſtance of doctrines, and preſcriptions. 2. The accidents, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of giving: For the ſubſtance of doctrine, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all, Jews, and Gentiles, as having at firſt an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in mens hearts,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.</note> and being by immediate voice of God delivered to Adam: Touching accidents, under which comes the delivery of it written, in two Tables, by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God in Sinai; ſo, not given to Gentiles, but to Jews onely, no not to Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob; as Moſes am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies the Lords love to the people of his time, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.3. <hi>He made not this Covenant with our fathers but with us;</hi> The Negative ſeems abſolute; but is reſpective onely to the manner of giving.</p>
               <p>But howſoever the law was given to the Gentiles whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in writing, or otherwiſe, the Apoſtles ground ſeems infirm? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſing the Cavilſome objection of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiaries, firm enough: For this very circumſtance they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſtrangely, in the point of juſtification: that the law was given in writing to the Jews, with promiſe of life to the obſerving thereof; which in their judgement had been vain, except righteouſneſs might be in part by the law? ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which ſuppoſition, the Apoſtle in this place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Now, though I love not extravagances, yet let me have leave a little, upon occaſion of this queſtion thus aſſoiled, to note the idle inference of ſome Antiſabbathiſts: Therefore, ſay they, The precept of Sabbath binds not the Church of the Gentiles, becauſe the Decalogue was given onely to Jews? <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why inferre they not the like for other Precepts, and ſo become abſolute <hi>Antinomi? Object.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, other precepts are revived, in Scriptures of the new Teſtament, &amp; their recitall there gives them authority with us? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Belike then, no precept of the Decalogue binds futher, then it is recited in the new Teſtament: It was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105203:80"/>wont to be taught, that the whole Decalogue ſtands in force for ever unto our conſciences, in reſpect of that congruence it hath with the Law eternall, and the impreſsion it once had in our hearts, in Creation ſome <hi>rudera</hi> whereof, in all the Commandments, are to be found in very Ethnicks.</p>
               <p>But, to their argument. It is fallacious, and, except it be limited, untrue. Take the Decalogue for the (ſubſtance) of precepts therein contained, ſo it is given to Gentiles; reſpect the (circumſtances) and accidents of giving, as the writing in ſo many letters and ſyllables, &amp;c. ſo the peculiar favour of Iews; but ſo underſtood it affords no ſuch concluſion. Leave we them, and ſee what out of this argument we may obſerve.</p>

                  </label> That is chiefly this;
An anſwer to a thread bare argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtitiaries, ancient and modern, that reaſon from the reviving of the Law in Sinai, to prove an intention in the Law-giver, to juſtifie us by the Law, and to give us pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to perform it to juſtification? <hi>Anſw.</hi> If from that ground, we may infer a poſſibility to be juſtified by the Law; from the ſelf-ſame may we prove juſtification to be peculiar to the nation of the Jews; for theirs onely was the giving of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. But the promiſe belongs to Gentiles, as well as to Jews: <hi>Ergò.</hi> Whereto then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the reviving of the Law? <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions;</hi> not ſo much to reſtrain them by preſcriptions and threats,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theoph. ad Gal.</hi> 3.</note> as <hi>Chryſoſtome and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and after them <hi>Theophylact; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t pro fraenis eſſet lex il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Iudaeis, quae hos vel à mandatorum quorundam tranſgreſſu, etſi non omnium prohiberet:</hi> but rather to detect and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, as <hi>Auguſtine centies</hi> interprets; agreeably to the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and 5.20.</p>
               <p>Here alſo occurs that obſervation before made, <hi>ad ver.</hi> 11. That the promiſe of righteouſneſs and ſalvation belongs to Gentiles believing, and not to Jews onely: becauſe it hath been often fore-treated, I will not long inſiſt on it: onely, ſith the Apoſtle is pleaſed ſo often to inculcate it, and here
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105203:80"/>to add new confirmation; it ſhall not be amiſs to explane his proofs, againſt the fooliſh limitation and encloſure of <hi>Abraehams</hi> covenant made by Jews to themſelves. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Apoſtle is this, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is father of us all both Gentiles and Iews believing: the covenant and promiſes therefore belong to the whol ſeed and generation of believers. Becauſe the antecedent might be doubted, the Apoſtle firſt proves the univerſall paternity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after illuſtrates it; the proof we have extant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.5. whwere the Lord, to ſignifie the point in hand, is pleaſed to alter the name of <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abraham;</hi> himſelf giving the <hi>Etymon</hi> and ſignification, <hi>Becauſe a father of many nations I have made thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How then ſay Iews, that the Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> belongs to them onely, and think the fidelity of God muſt needs fall to the ground; if either they be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Gentiles admitted to be the people of God. Certes, the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> conſidered with the ſignification pointed at, by the Impoſer, might well have taught them; that other nations believing, as well as Iews, might call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> father; themſelves being, though a populous nation, yet but one nation; whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> hath promiſe to be father of many. And of the argument thus farre. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows now the illuſtration of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Univerſall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie.</p>

                  </label> So that the ſenſe is this; So far hath God honoured <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that in reſpect thereof, he hath made him like himſelf, a father, not of this or that nation; but univerſally of all, amongſt all nations, believing after his example.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of which particle is thus conceived by <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact:</hi> The Iews ſeemed zealous of <hi>Abrahams</hi> honour and prerogatives, and thought them much impeached, if his works were excluded from his juſtification, &amp;c. but in the mean time, denying his fatherhood to be the reward of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,

               <p>The ſecond point of illuſtration, is the means, whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> became father of nations; and that is, by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: like him whom he believed: take the addition cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, and that faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is explicated by the ground of it.

                  </label> The points are theſe:
Firſt, That <hi>Abraham</hi> by believing, or in reſpect of faith, became father of the nations, as <hi>Theophylact pro praeſtita fide;</hi> for the faith which he ſhewed, he received this as a reward, <hi>to be father of Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inferences thence are theſe: Firſt, That the Jewes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105203:81"/>carnall deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſevered from faith, made them not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> I mean that ſeed, to which the promiſes of <hi>Abraham</hi> belonged: compare <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.39, 40. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond this; That Gentiles believing, are that ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though they deſcended not out of his loyns: Know ye, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>That they which are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham;</hi> and again, <hi>They which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull Abraham;</hi> Gal. 3.7, 9.</p>
               <p>That this may the better appear; Let us conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Nations ſtand: The Relative, is <hi>Abraham;</hi> The Correlative, the Nations, or his ſeed. What is here the foundation of the relation between them? Namely faith; that is it, that makes <hi>Abraham</hi> Father of nations; that it therefore, that makes the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his children: <hi>Abraham</hi> by believing, became Father unto the Nations; we therefore by believing, become Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Where faith hath place, there is place for this relation to <hi>Abraham;</hi> where that is wanting, the relation ceaſeth; for that is in this relation, the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that vainly do unbelieving Jewes, lay claim to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Covenant, in reſpect of the naturall bond of bloud between them: and on the other ſide; ſoundly do Gentiles believing, make title to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, in reſpect of the propinquity faith hath founded betwixt them.</p>

                  </label> The Second point here obſervable,
is the ground of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith; that was the power of God, which he conſidered in the wonderfull effects whereto it extends: And let us note it, as a piller for faith to reſt on; the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and unreſiſtable power of the promiſer: It it well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that in great prudence, the pen-men of the Apoſtles creed, prefixed the article of Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, as a ſtaff to ſupport our frail faith, when ever the ſtrange and ſupernaturall works of God, after mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

                  </label> For theſenſe of the words: <note place="margin">Sasbout, Cajetan, &amp; alii.</note> Many Interpreters take them particularly; and thus interpret: <hi>Who quickeneth the dead]</hi> That is, that gives generative virtue, to men diſabled for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſo putting (as it were) a new life into them. <hi>And calleth the things that are not as if they were]</hi> That is, that makes eximious, things contemptible: the Gentiles that were no people, a people of God.</p>
               <p>I rather think, they are to be taken in their largeſt ſenſe, according to the immediate purport of the words; though I confeſs, <hi>Abraham</hi> from them inferred the particulars of his promiſe: and thus conceive <hi>Abraham</hi> to have reaſoned, for the eſtabliſhing of his faith. His firſt concluſion is this; My body now as dead, in reſpect of the act of generation, God will quicken, and make vigorous. His argument; God by his power can quicken the dead; therefore, he can give generative vigour to my dead body.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Concluſion: The ſeed promiſed, though it yet ſubſiſt not; yet ſhall have being. His argument, God by his word makes things to be, that are not: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The queſtion here moved by ſome ſeems to me imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: Whether it be Gods property onely to raiſe the dead? inaſmuch as the Apoſtles purpoſe here is, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver theſe, as effects peculiar to Gods power; but rather to ſhew, that they are things ſubject to his power; Which was that, that <hi>Abraham</hi> conſidered, for eſtabliſhment of his faith. In the mean time, I joyn with them in the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That theſe effects fall not under the compaſs of any created power: for howſoever we read of ſome Prophets, and Apoſtles, that rayſed up the dead; yet was not the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that quickened them inherent in them; they being but inſtruments, if ſo much; rather ſignifiers of Gods will to effect ſuch miracles. In a word, in all miraculous effects, three ſorts of cauſes muſt be diſtinguiſhed. 1. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall efficient, that is, Gods power. 2. The inſtrument, or
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105203:83"/>mean cauſe; which ſometimes are creatures, and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not ſo much elevated above their naturall ability; as choſen of God to be attended with his divine virtue. 3. The cauſe diſpoſitive, which is <hi>fides miraculoſa.

               <p>In theſe ſpirituall effects of his power inſtances we have daily. How many dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by his ſpirit, to newneſs of life?

               <p>The ſpecialties commendable in Abrahams faith expreſſed in this verſe, are two. 1. His courage. 2. His prudence in Believing. His courage, in that <hi>againſt hope, he believed in hope.</hi>

                  </label> From whoſe example we learn, in the midſt of deſpair,
ſtill to hope, where we have Gods promiſe for our warrant: Beſides Abrahams example, we have like practice in Job; a mirrour not of patience onely, but of faith: Who would reſt on him for life, whom he feels wounding, even to Death? Yet, <hi>Though he kill me,</hi> ſaith Job, <hi>I will truſt in him, Job</hi> 13.15.</p>
               <p>To their practice, let us add the conſideration of defects in this kind ſeverely puniſhed; in Moſes, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.13, 20, 21, 22. The incredulous Prince, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.1, 2, 17. <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Luke</hi> 1.18, 20, 22.</p>
               <p>In a word; In Believing there are four degrees, one more excellent then another. 1. That which is exerciſed in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of means. 2. Where the means are weak, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the promiſe. 3. In the want of means. 4.

There fall out times with Gods children, when if we ſhall make ſenſe, or naturall cauſes the meaſure of faith; a thouſand to one, but we are ſwallowed up of deſpair: The Lord ſometimes writes bitter things againſt us, and makes us poſſeſs the ſinnes of our youth; ſeems to ſurcharge Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with imputation of thoſe ſinnes, the pardon whereof he commands us to believe: What ſhall a poor ſoul do, in this caſe, to keep it ſelf to the task of faith? Surely, what thou feeleſt God to impute, believe he will pardon to thy repentance, for ſo runs the promiſe.</p>
               <p>There are times, when we may feel decayes of grace, and declinings in obedience; yet, ſith it is his promiſe to give perſeverence, without interruption, believe thou ſhalt ſtand, even while thou thinkeſt, thou art falling, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Helps to ſtabliſh faith, in this kind, are theſe. 1. To reſt on the naked promiſe of God. 2. Conſideration of the tranſcendency of Gods power, able to work without, above, yea againſt nature,

That the rule, and meaſure of a wiſe mans faith, is the word of God; ſo that, all the Lord ſpeaks, muſt be believed; onely what he ſpeaks, muſt be believed: And in this generall, we, and Papiſts accord: The rule, and object of Chriſtian faith, is <hi>Veritas prima;</hi> and the <hi>adaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum objectum</hi> of faith, is the Word of God: But that word, ſay they, is of two ſorts: <hi>Scriptum, &amp; Traditum; Written and Traditionary:</hi> Both theſe together make us a perfect rule of faith; Scripture without Tradition, is <hi>regula,</hi> but <hi>partialis.</hi>

The Scriptures, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> are able to make thee wiſe to ſalvation; to make the man of God perfect, throughly furniſhed unto every good work: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford they us wiſdome ſufficient to ſalvation?

                  </note> therefore they contain doctrine ſufficient for faith, and practice: And that there may be no place for that idle evaſion of our adverſaries; limitting the ſufficiency of written doctrine, to what is neceſſary for Laiques: Both <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and him they they were able to make wiſe to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and generally, ſaith the Apoſtle, they completely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the man of God, that is, the Miniſter, to every good work of his calling.</p>
               <p>Our Second argument is this; The written rule of practice, we are ſure is perfect; both for that the Lord gives ſo ſtrait charge, to add nothing thereto, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. and becauſe there cannot the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be named, which the Law of God preſcribeth not; nor the ſin thought of, which it forbids not: May we think to evade this teſtimony, with that Nicety of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> add not by depraving the ſenſe; nay, as appears by the Lords own often reproof of doctrins of men, in matter of his worſhip, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13. and his heavy judgments on thoſe that altered but circumſtances of his preſcripts, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. additions, as well by new preſcripts, as by falſe gloſſes, are here forbidden.</p>
               <p>May we think, the rule of faith is left more at randome, and uncertain: How then doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſo reſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Anathema</hi> to him, that ſhall teach any other thing,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105203:86"/>then what they taught, and the people received, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. Perhaps, they will ſay, under their doctrine of faith comes chiefly, what they delivered in Preaching, by word of mouth.

               <p>Some chiefe of their arguments ſhall be propounded: If Scriptures be ſufficient, either the whole Canon of Scriptures joyntly taken, or the ſeverall parts: but neither the whole, becauſe ſome parts are loſt; nor the ſeverall books. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Anſwers are given to the <hi>minor;</hi> that both the whole is ſufficient, and perfect, according to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requiſite for the whole; and the parts alſo perfect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to perfection of parts: That ſome parts of the Canon are loſt they are not able to prove; their inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being all, either of writings not canonicall, as ſome of <hi>Solomons</hi> Songs, and Proverbs; or elſe parts of Scripture extant, though not under the names of thoſe, to whom they are aſſigned; as thoſe aſcribed to <hi>Nathan, Ahia, &amp; Iddo:</hi> For fuller anſwer, Let us conſider that the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, touching Scriptures now extant: Whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we have, be a ſufficient rule of faith and practice?</p>
               <p>How impertinent is it, to tell us that part of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Canon is loſt; which though it were yielded, impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth nothing of the truth of what we hold, concerning full perfection of Scripture now extant, for the Church that now is, and ſhall be to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Our concluſion is this; Since the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there never was wanting to the Church, a written Canon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſufficient for the times of the Church; ſometimes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105203:87"/>it was more narrow; ſometimes more large: ever perfect, <hi>ſecundum tempus,</hi> as <hi>Lumbard</hi> diſtinguiſheth; never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in any neceſſary point of faith, or practice.</p>
               <p>Their Second argument, is from induction of particulars, neceſſary to be believed, or done, which yet are not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scriptures; as that there are ſome books of Divine inſpiration; that theſe now bearing that credit are they, that they have ſuch Authors, as they pretend, &amp;c. None whereof are taught in Scripture: <hi>Anſw.</hi> For this laſt, of the certainty of Penmen, whoſe names they carry, this that we anſwer: Firſt, That many of them give teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to their Authors. Secondly, That the ignorance of the Penmen, impeacheth nothing of the fulneſs of neceſſary knowledg: It ſufficeth, that we know, they have God for their Author, though his ſecretary, or ſcribe be to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
               <p>As for their other particulars; That we know not the Scriptures to have proceeded from God,
<note place="margin">Scotus, in Prolegom. ad Magiſtum.</note> but only by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Hear their own <hi>Scotus,</hi> and his followers, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all that queſtion of the Heavenly Author of them, or any part of them, by Scriptures themſelves: His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments theſe. 1. Propheticall prenunciations all verified by events. 2. Perfect concord, and conſent of ſcriptures. 3. Credit, and candor of the penmen. 4, The reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the things therein contained. 5. The unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of errours, and hereſies in things, wherein they oppoſe the doctrins of ſcripture. 6. The ſtableneſs of the Church, profeſſing doctrine of Scriptures, and puniſhments of thoſe oppoſing it. 7. Clarity of miracles, &amp;c. Theſe and the like hath <hi>Scotus,</hi> as arguments, in his judgment, ſufficient to ſtop the mouthes of any Atheiſt, or Heretique, that ſhall queſtion their inſpiration from God.</p>
               <p>And I will boldly ſay, The Scriptures carry as expreſs characters of a divine author; as the creatures, of the power, or wiſdome of the Creator: The Doctrine ſo holy, ſo majeſticall, ſo divinely powerfull to humble, to comfort,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105203:87"/>to convert the ſoul, that it is as abſurdly queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be the inſpirer of Scripture, as he is the maker of Heaven, and Earth: There is no creature ſo high, or low, but carries this inſcription, <hi>Deus me fecit;</hi> No Scripture, nor ſentence of it, wherein a man, not blind, may not read this Title, <hi>Deus me inſpiravit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is vain to object, that ſundry have queſtioned this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; For ſo have many done Gods Creation of the world: ſuch <hi>quaere's</hi> ariſe out mens blindneſs to which, the cleareſt things are queſtionable.</p>
               <p>For other particulars, they are either expreſſely, or by implication, taught in the Scripture, if neceſſary; or elſe, are ſuch points of faith, or practice, as in the concluſion are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireable; For that of infants Baptiſm, Scripture preſcribes in Generalls Principles equivalent; For that of the bleſſed Maries perpetuall Virginitie, <hi>poſt partum;</hi> a point that we piouſly believe, according to ſome probabilities of Scripture; No matter of ſuch weight, as that the doubting, or deniall thereof ſhould ſhut us up under condemnation.</p>
               <p>To leave theſe men, to their vain faith, and converſation, taught by their fathers traditions, from which Chriſt with his bloud hath ranſomed us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. Let us in matter of faith learn <hi>Abrahams</hi> prudence, believe according to that we know the Lord hath ſpoken: And this rule let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; it is partiall infidelity to deny credence to any thing delivered in Scriptures; Fancy, not Faith, to believe as Gods truth, what he hath not in Scriptures revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
               <p>And here, I cannot but take notice of the folly of many amongſt us, Wiſe, it may be, in their generation, wiſer in their own conceit; Their profeſſion is this, in the point of believing; They had rather believe too much, then too little: and, in that ſottiſh reſolution, how many groſs errours drink they in, almoſt to the bane of their ſouls? It cals to mind that fable ſhould I call it, or ſtory rather; of a woman in the dayes of Popiſh darkneſs, accuſed to her Confeſſour, for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105203:88"/>denying Chriſts carnall preſence in the Sacrament; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charged by the Prieſt with that point of hereſie, made anſwer for her ſelf, That ſhe never made queſtion of any ſuch matter: And believeſt thou indeed, ſaith her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, that Chriſt is there preſent, Fleſh, Bloud and Bone, as he was born of the Virgine? Not He onely, ſaith the woman but his bleſſed Mother alſo: <hi>O woman,</hi> replies this Seraphicall Doctour, <hi>great is thy faith:</hi> or rather, O man, great is thy impious folly to approve as points of faith, ſuch ſottiſh dreams: a juſt parallel for our men ſo ſuperfluous, and ſupererogatory in matter of believing.</p>

<note place="margin">Cajetan. ad loc.</note> he bewrayed ſome incredulity: and at other times, as <hi>Cajetane</hi> conjectures, was not without ſome doubtfulneſs of this promiſe. Now, what, when it is yielded, <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was, at ſometime, perfect, in reſpect of this particular promiſed? The Law to juſtification requires an univerſall perfection of all virtues as well as of faith; and in faith, perfection not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome particulars; but of all truths revealed; and that, not at ſometimes onely, but perpetually, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>

                  </label> The difficulties thus rid, let us now ſee what we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for our further profit. Where firſt offers it ſelf that diſtinction of faith, according to the divers degrees, and meaſures thereof in believers: There is weak faith, and ſtrong faith, there are men of no faith, as infidels; men of weak faith as novices; men ſtrong in faith as was <hi>Abraham, Matt.</hi> 14.31. <hi>O thou of little faith,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter: Matth.</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:105203:89"/>15.28. <hi>O woman, great is thy faith,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Canaanitiſh woman: Chriſt found not ſo great faith in Iſrael, as in the Centurion; ſome in Iſrael, not ſo great as in an alien.</p>
               <p>The greatneſs or ſmalneſs of faith, is three wayes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: 1. In reſpect of the things to be believed; ſo, it is more or leſs, according as things believed are more or leſſe in number. 2. According as things believed are more or leſs diſtinctly conceived; the more implicite faith is, the leſs it is; the more explicite, the greater. 3. According as the aſſent to things believed, is more or leſs firm; more or leſs free from doubting: and in this laſt ſenſe we muſt conceive the Apoſtle; <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtrong in faith, becauſe he doubts not of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Queſtions here offering themſelves are theſe: Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weak faith have in it juſtifying virtue? or, Whether a man weakly believing, have title to juſtification, according to the Covenant? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Weak faith, if true, gives title to juſtification: our Saviour ſpeaking of faith miraculous, ſaith; The leaſt degree of it, even the grain of muſtard ſeed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17.6.</note> is available to miracles, even of greateſt nature; it holds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally of faith juſtifying, to the uſes whereto it ſerves; the leaſt meaſure is of force to juſtification. 2. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that it is not the greatneſs of faith that juſtifieth: Faith as it is a virtue, or gift in us hath not juſtifying virtue; but as it apprehends the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby we are juſtified; which apprehenſion may be as true in him, that believes weakly, as in him, whoſe faith is more firm. 3. It is not to be forgotten, that as the defects of other gifts, and parts of obedience are covered with Chriſts perfection, ſo that they hinder not juſtification; ſo is alſo the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be demanded; How we may diſcern our faith to be true, while it is weak? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, if 1. It ſtrive againſt doubting, and infidelitie. 2. If it be carefull to get ſtrength by means that God hath ſanctified,

                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. 3. If that weak perſwaſion we have of Gods love, and pardon of our ſins, breed care to purifie our hearts, and to pleaſe God, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9,</p>
               <p>The next point in the text is, the ſignes of ſtrength in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> faith, two in number: Firſt this, That he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not the oppoſition in courſe of nature made againſt the promiſe. 2. That he doubted not of the promiſe, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the matter, how it could have accompliſhment. For the firſt, Whether we conſider it as a ſigne, or as a means of <hi>Abrahams</hi> firmneſs in believing, is not much materiall. It is no ſmall ſigne of ſtable faith, to paſſe by notice of things that oppoſe Gods promiſe; and a great means to ſtabliſh faith, the withdrawing of our minds from beholding the things, that may hinder the accompliſhment of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. This once is clear, that the firſt ſtep to incredulity, is the looſing of our thoughts, to rove towards things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gods promiſe; and demitting our minds to behold the impediments of ſecond cauſes: Thus fell <hi>Zachary</hi> incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to queſtion the promiſe of God, whiles he conſidered his own. and his wifes old age, diſabled (as he thought) for procreation, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.18. Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> in like ſort, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. thus <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 11.21. Thus Gods children, at this day; Their ſins great, therefore not capable of pardon: Corruptions ſtrong and ſettled by evil cuſtome, therefore not poſſible to be mortified: Grace ſmall, temptations ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and violent; therefore perſeverance impoſſible.</p>

The ſecond ſigne of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtrength in faith is, That he doubted not of the promiſe; where alſo the generall cauſe of doubting is expreſſed, that is, unbelief. Touching the ſenſe ſee the former explanation.</p>
               <p>The points we have here obſervable: 1. A difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt faithleſneſs and doubtfulneſs; ſuch as is betwixt the Cauſe and the Effect: Not every one that doubts, is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, though doubting argue ſome meaſure of unbelief: A man merely faithleſs denies all aſſent to truth propounded; in doubtfulneſs is ſome aſſent, though not without fear, that the contrary may be true.</p>
               <p>I obſerve it the rather, reſpecting the weakneſs of ſome amongſt Gods Children, that perplexed with doubtings paſs cenſure of meer faithleſneſs upon themſelves: Saith our Saviour to <hi>Peter</hi> doubting,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.31.</note> 
                  <hi>oh thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> Doubtings argues weakneſs of faith, not a nullity of believing.</p>
               <p>A Second point obſervable is the fountain of doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that is unbelief; doubting is a fruit of unbelief; ſo far as we are doubtfull, ſo far are we faithleſs: from faith proceeds nothing but certainty; wavering therefore iſſues from want of faith.</p>
               <p>If any demand, whether ſuch as doubt may be preſumed to have faith? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtfulneſs, though it agree not to the nature of faith, yet may meet with faith in the ſame ſubject. Why not, as well as other corruption with grace? Fleſh with ſpirit, knowledg with ignorance, rebellion with obedience hard-heartedneſs, with remorſefulneſs, &amp;c. So hath God tempted all gifts of the ſpirit in us, that their contraries are abated, not aboliſhed: Whence iſſue in Gods Children acts not of grace only, but of corruption alſo; yea, in the ſame act of Gods Saints, a ſpice of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as well as a relliſh of grace, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. And, as the argument is ill, there is (ſome) rebellion, therefore (no) inclination to obedience; ſome corruption, therefore no grace: ſo as ill followes it; there is ſome
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105203:91"/>doubtfulnes, therefore no faith: But, though this be true, yet doubtfulneſs hath no other fountain, then unbelief.</p>
               <p>And it ſerves, firſt, to ſhew the vain contentment, and ſelf-pleaſing, many through miſpriſion, conceive from their doubtings; even hence concluding the ſincerity of faith, from the ſenſe of doubtings.</p>
               <p>Their errour I would gladly reform, and it ſprings from hence: We ſay, truly it is preſumption, not faith, that's never encountred with doubtings; and they have no faith at all, that never had conflict with infidelity: though this be true, yet in doubtfulneſs ſimply none hath comfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a fruit of infidelity. The ſenſe of unbelief is occaſionally comfortably; and ſtriving againſt doubting; is a ſign of faith; in this thou haſt no comfort, that thou doubteſt; but this is the comfort, that thou ſeeſt thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, bewaileſt it, and ſtriveſt againſt it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſerves to admoniſh us, to ſtrive againſt doubtings, and to pray with the Diſciples, <hi>Lord help our unbelief, Luk.</hi> 17.6. The root is bitter, out of which it grows; the vice, moſt diſhonourable to God, moſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to our ſelves, unbelief. 2. This banes our prayers, and makes them return empty from our God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.7.3. Breeds wavering in Chriſtian profeſſion, and practice. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.4. In a word, makes all duties flow coldly from us, whileſt we queſtion Gods power, or will, to reward them. 5. Diſhonours the promiſer, by queſtioning his ability, or readineſs to perform what he hath promiſed: And, that is it, which in the contrary comes next to be treated.</p>
               <p>From the ſigns of ſtrength in <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith; the Apoſtle paſſeth to the effect thereof, <hi>He gave glory to God, by ſuch his believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giving glory to God</hi>] We may not ſo conceive, as if any reall acceſs of glory came to God, by <hi>Abrahams</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; he is for gloriouſneſs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and no reall addition, or diminution comes to his glory from the creatures of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105203:91"/>and in himſelf he hath all perfection of glory; before the worlds were; his wiſdome and power, the truth were in him, in the ſame infinite meaſure, as now by his works he procures not glory; but either manifeſts, or communicates it to his Creatures: But we are ſaid to give him glory, in way, either of acknowledgement, or publication: ſo Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, by believing, gave glory to God, inaſmuch as thereby he acknowledged the power, and truth of the Promiſer.</p>
               <p>The point to be obſerved, is; How glorious a thing it is to God, firmly to believe, and reſt upon his word: I know not, whether by any one Duty, God reap more honour, then from this of believing; His power, his truth, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his mercy. Attributes that the Lord counts moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to himſelf, and deſires rathereſt to be acknowledged amongſt men, by believing we acknowledge: Yea, if there be any other office, and duty, whereby Gods glory is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and occaſionally acknowledged by others, from faith it iſſues; Profeſſion, Patience, Love, Mercy, or if there be any other virtue, by exerciſe whereof men are excited to glorifie God; From Faith they all flow, as from their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: And I marvell not at the Lords ſo ſore indignation againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his friend, for not ſanctifying him, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; read <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.51. <hi>Num.</hi> 20.12. and, 27.14. and, 11.21, 22, 23. a greater diſhonour he could ſcarcely have done to the majeſty of God: Faith thinks highly of God, Incredulity abaſeth him.</p>
               <p>By this we may take occaſion to judge of that doctrine of Doubting ſo much commended by adverſaries to Gods people, as more honourable unto God, then is ours of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: That we may not ſeem to wrong them, let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Generall faith they allow to be undoubtfull; Faith ſpeciall they make the <hi>Lutherans dream,</hi> having no ground at all in the word of God: their meaning is, that what is in generall taught, touching the power, and truth of God, in fulfilling his promiſes, muſt and may be believed with undoubtfull faith; For our particular, to believe, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105203:92"/>to (us) he will give Remiſſion of ſinnes, perſeverance, and life eternall; they teach the performance to be to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rate of Gods children, impoſſible, and groundleſs; the attempt arrogant and preſumptuous: Hope it we may out of a probable conjecture; believe it we may not, as out of infallible evidence: Hence are thoſe often commendations given to a courſe holden betwixt doubtfull Hope, and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, Fear, in our paſſage towards Gods kingdome. Where, Firſt, I demand.; Whether there may not, or ought to be ſpeciall Faith of Gods Power? my meaning is, whether a man be not bound to believe, that God can pardon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſinnes, and give him life eternall? and whether the doubting thereof, in reſpect of our Perſons, be not cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of unbelief? It is truly ſaid, <hi>Cain</hi> ſinned more, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of Gods mercy, and denying his power to forgive his ſinne, then in embruing his hands in his brothers bloud, ſpeciall Faith then there may, and ought to be touching Gods power to perform his promiſe. Let us ſee, whether like faith ought not to be concerning Gods truth, and Will to perform it. 1. Commandment is given to pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our own ſinnes, to pray for perſeverance, and life eternall; and a requiſite condition in available prayer, to believe, not onely that God can, but that he will give what we pray for; ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 11.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. How then is it a point of arrogancy, to endeavour ſpeciall faith? 2. Beſides this, What diſhonour is this to the ſpirit of God, not to believe his teſtimony given in our hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105203:92"/>or of his Will; of the Generall, or for our own Particular.</p>
               <p>Let all Gods children, to whom God hath given repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, take notice of their doubtings, as things diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God, and derogatory from the glory of his power, and truth, and mercy: What, when God proclaimeth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don even to bloudy ſinnes repented. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. ſhall we queſtion, whether in mercy he can or will forgive the ſins we have forſaken? when he hath ratified all his promiſes in the bloud of his Sonne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. ſhall we queſtion, whether he mean ſooth, in promiſing his children pardon, protection, perſeverance, or life eternal? God forbid! I ſay not, we can at all times, free our ſelves of doubtings: onely I adviſe to take notice of them, as of ſinnes, not of lighteſt nature; detracting ſo much from the glory of the power, or truth, or goodneſs of the promiſer.

               <p>THe fruit of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is here expreſſed that is his juſtification: The depravations of this Scripture by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105203:93"/>Adverſaries are many. Let us briefly take view of them: The firſt is from the illation; <hi>Therefore it was imputed, &amp;c.</hi> Hence they collect, that faith avails to juſtification virtuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by way of merit: Man is juſtified by faith, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it apprehends the promiſe but becauſe it obteins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinns, <hi>&amp; ſuo quodam modo etiam mereatur:</hi> how infer they the concluſion out of this Scripture? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this place, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellar. de juſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> ſets down the cauſe why <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was reputed juſtice, to wit, becauſe by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, he gave glory to God; therefore for the merit of that faith, he juſtified <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, firſt, let us weigh how they utterly croſſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Apoſtle in his whole diſcourſe; which is to exclude all merits of men from juſtification: can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he excludes the merit of other works, to ſubſtitute the merit of faith? 2. Beſides that, it is eaſily obſervable, that the Apoſtle maintains a continuall oppoſition betwixt faith and merit; as <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>To their argument thus we anſwer; That the Apoſtles illation indeed implyes a ſequel of juſtification, upon the performance of faith; yet none ſuch as is cauſed by the merit, and excellency of the gifs or work of faith, above other works: and this is that deceives them; that they can conceive no connexion betwixt our offices, and Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but what the worth and merit of our performances cauſeth.</p>
               <p>Know we therefore, 1. That there is an infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt faith and juſtification, ſo that every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, is without faith juſtified. But 2. If the reaſon of this connexion be demanded, it is apparently Gods covenant and promiſe; therefore ſhall every believer receive remiſſion of ſins; becauſe ſo runs the promiſe in the covenant of grace, Believe, and thy ſins ſhall be forgiven:

               <p>And if <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith were the meritorious cauſe of his juſtification; I demand, whether as faith, or as ſuch faith? that is, whether in reſpect that he believed; or in reſpect that he believed in this full meaſure, was he juſtified? If in reſpect of his meaſure, then methinks it will follow, that only ſuch meaſure of faith ſufficeth to juſtification; &amp; ſo the diſciples of Chriſt ſo doubtfull and wavering in many main articles till after Chriſts aſcenſion, muſt be reputed, for that time, unjuſtified: if faith ſimply, in what meaſure ſoever, then can it not be meritorious; ſith in the beginnings, it is ſo ful of imperfection: Thus I conclude. Faith is an antecedent, no cauſe properly of juſtification; juſtification a conſequent of believing; no effect iſſuing out of the virtue, and merit of faith;

                  <hi>therefore</hi>) notes not the cauſe of the conſequent, but of the ſequel, or conſequence, ſaith a learned Divine.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond collection is this;
<note place="margin">Rhemenſ. ad loc.</note> That faith juſtifying is a generall faith, whereby we aſſent to the truth of Gods ſpeeches in generall,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de juſtif. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> and no ſuch ſpeciall faith or affiance, as Proteſtants require to juſtification. Their reaſon: The faith whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified, was no other then this, A general perſwaſion of Gods faithfulneſs and power at large. <hi>Ergò. Anſw.</hi> The queſtion hath been largely handled, <hi>ad verſ.</hi> 3. whither I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>To their argument thus I anſwer; their antecedent is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true: <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was not of Gods truth and power in generall onely; but of both applyed to the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. From theſe generals he concluded the particular touching the ſeed, in whom all nations ſhould be bleſſed. In his believing, and the matter of it, we muſt conceive ſomething propounded, and conſidered as a concluſion; ſomthing as an argument, or premiſſes inferring the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; to both which <hi>Abraham</hi> aſſented: To the concluſion, by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105203:94"/>virtue of the premiſſes; The concluſion was particular, I ſhall have a ſeed, in whom all nations, and my ſelf alſo ſhall be bleſſed. The premiſſes theſe; God that hath promiſed is faithfull and able to give it. In reſpect of the premiſſes, his faith is generall: In reſpect of the concluſion, particular, as we ſee.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, we conceive the faith of every juſtified man to proceed; from generalls to their own particular, and to the particular, by virtue of the generals: Aſſent they yield to generals, but with reference ſtill to particulars. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; That which for comfort of conſcience caſt down by the Law, they believe, is this particular concluſion; My ſins are, or ſhall be forgiven me: How come they to believe this particular? <hi>Anſw.</hi> By belief of generals: The ſins of all that believe in Chriſt, are for Chriſts ſake forgiven accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods promiſes in the Evangelical Covenant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſins are forgiven me, ſince I have received by grace to reſt on Chriſt, for the pardon of my ſins: ſo is faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, Generall in reſpect of the premiſſes, Particular in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the concluſion.</p>
               <p>Their third deduction: Faith concurrs to juſtification, not as an inſtrument, but as the formal cauſe of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; For, <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was imputed juſtice, &amp;c.

               <p>THe paſſage to this laſt member, we may thus conceive: The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth ſome weakling thus to enquire: It is true,
<note place="margin">Theophylact. ad loc. quid noſtra intereſt.</note> thou haſt taught of <hi>Abraham</hi> that his faith was to him imputed to righteouſneſs; But what is that to us? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was not written for him only, as matter of his glory, and priviledg; but for us alſo, for our profit, and comfort.</p>
               <p>The points of the text are three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The uſe and comfort ariſing to us, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The condition required of us, to the end we may ſhare with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the bleſſing of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reaſon brought to aſſure us of like favour, in like faith, &amp;c. for better confirming the comfort unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was not written for him only, &amp;c. but for us alſo.</hi> Where firſt obſerve we, The method of converſing in the hiſtories of the Saints; let it ſtill be with reference to our ſelves, and our uſe, <hi>They were written for us;</hi> ſee Rom. 15.4. Heb. 11. and 12. Their favours, for our comfort; their chaſtiſements, for our terrour; their vertues, to our patterns; their falls, for our caution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:105203:95"/>
And it is idle to conceit them, as encomiaſticall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their glory only; Gods Spirit intended their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords to our benefit.</p>
               <p>A Second generall here obſervable, is, That Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull proceedings with his children are exemplary; he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Abraham</hi> believing, he ſhall juſtifie us alſo, performing like faith: He pardoneth <hi>Paul</hi> repenting his blaſphemies, and made <hi>him a pattern to all that ſhall believe in him, to eternall life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. He ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> from the deluge; delivered <hi>Lot</hi> from the fire of Sodome: <hi>Peters</hi> inference, from theſe particulars, is this generall; <hi>God knows to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his, out of temptation,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a diſcomfortable miſpriſion of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in temptations, to conceive Gods favour, as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of ſome eminent amongſt his Saints, and their great weakneſs, to ſtudy differences, betwixt themſelves, and others, in points of neceſſary comforts: For, to yield that there were, that had their ſpeciall prerogatives in ſome particulars; as Prophets to be taught by dreams, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and immediate inſpirations, &amp;c. Yet in matter gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary for comfort of conſcience, and eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, what was vouchſafed one, may be expected of all. 1. The Covenant is made with all, without difference, with the leaſt, as well as with the greateſt, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. 2. The mediation of Chriſt available for all 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. of all ſorts, ſexes, nations, and ranks of men: God, is he the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> only? nay, even of his ſeed alſo: Chriſt, is he the Mediatour for Apoſtles only? nay, even for all, that the Lord hath given him out of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9. Their is neither male, nor female bond nor free, weak, nor ſtrong, but all are one in Chriſt Jeſus: The ſame blood of Chriſt redeemed all; the ſame love of God embraced all; the ſame ſpirit ſeals all, to the day of redemption; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in ſome is more evident, then in others; the image all one, wherewith all are ſtamped and thereby ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the day of redemption: The only thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105203:96"/>us, is, to provide we reſemble in our behaviour; the Lord we ſhall finde impartiall in his favours, if we be not diſſonant in our demeanure; and that is the next thing the text leads unto: To us it ſhall be imputed, as to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> believing as <hi>Abraham, in him that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead.</hi>

                  </label> The generall inſtruction the text affords,
is this; That a man deſiring to partake the favours of the Saints, muſt be carefull to reſemble the practice of Saints: Wouldeſt thou be juſtified as <hi>Abraham?</hi> believe as <hi>Abraham;</hi> pardoned as <hi>Paul?</hi> repent as <hi>Paul;</hi> delivered as <hi>Lot?</hi> be righteous as <hi>Lot:</hi> The ſame God is a like to all in his bleſſings, that are alike to him, in their obedience.</p>
               <p>There is a generation of men, enviouſly emulous of the priviledges of Gods Children, diſſolutely careleſs of their behaviour: Let my ſoul dye the death of the righteous, ſaith <hi>Balaam;</hi> but the helliſh wretch cares not to live the life of the righteous:

               <p>That for the Generall.</p>
               <p>View we now the Words, wherein are two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The duty it ſelf required of us, to the end we may ſhare with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the bleſſing of juſtification, believing in God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The object thereof, God ſet out here by a periphraſis, <hi>who raiſed up Ieſus from the dead.</hi>

                  </label> Senſe; <hi>Believing in God</hi>] The words thought not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in that form, yet import the condition required of us to juſtification, and are therefore well rendred, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe, by ſome tranſlatours; If we believe, or, ſo that we believe.</p>
               <p>Some here conceive the Apoſtle to deliver us, the nature of juſtifying faith; and to reſolve us, that it is rather an affiance, or putting truſt in God, then an aſſent, or giving credit to the truth of his promiſe. The queſtion hath been largely diſcuſſed, <hi>ad verſ.</hi> 3. Whether I remit the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>We may better hence collect the neceſſity, of putting truſt in God for righteouſneſs to juſtification, then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the faith that juſtifieth: And that is it the Apoſtle directly teacheth; that to juſtification, is neceſſary a relying upon God, through Chriſt, and putting confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, for juſtification; and withall, the infallible ſequel of juſtification, upon our confidence, placed in God for that bleſſing.</p>
               <p>As touching the nature of faith juſtifying, the Apoſtle intends not here to teach us; yet ſhall it not be amiſs, on this occaſion, to propound ſome arguments brought for that concluſion; as I heard them lately in conference with a friend, reverend for learning, and piety:
<note place="margin">Mr. J.D.</note> His judgment was, that faith juſtifying was rather an affiance, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt for righteouſneſs, then a perſwaſion of Gods love in Chriſt, or an aſſent to the promiſes of the Goſpel: His arguments theſe. Firſt, Faith that juſtifieth, (be it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105203:97"/>what it will be) muſt needs go before juſtification it ſelf; ſo doth affiance, ſo not particular faith: For it muſt firſt be true, that God juſtifieth me, before I can believe it; and in order of nature, there is truth in the propoſition, before the aſſent is given to the truth of it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Goſpel we may conceive, to offer themſelves to our minde, either in terms of the future tenſe; or, <hi>ſub verbis de praeſenti,</hi> or <hi>praeterito:</hi> As thus; God (will) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſins, and accept me to his favour for Chriſt; or thus, God (hath) pardoned my ſins, and doth accept me as righteous in Chriſt; accordingly, the aſſent thereto, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to a thing that ſhall be, or as to a thing already done: In the firſt obtaining of juſtification, the aſſent of faith is to the propoſition, <hi>De futuro;</hi> and that we are ſure had actual truth from everlaſting, concerning all thoſe that ſhall be heirs of ſalvation: The aſſent to the propoſition, <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> or <hi>praeterito,</hi> is, in order of nature, after juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: In time, for all that, they are <hi>ſimul;</hi> the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>de futuro,</hi> is in nature before it: ſo ſoon as I believe that God (will) pardon, he pardons: Before I believe that he (hath) pardoned, he hath pardoned: And that I think may ſuffice to aſſoyl that doubt, ſo expertly and acutely contrived.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, they ſhould attend, that the affiance they ſpeak of, iſſues out of the perſwaſion, we have of Gods love to us in Chriſt; for who can relye on God for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſalvation, that hath not ſome perſwaſion, that God is a father to him in Chriſt? So that what argument concludes the precedence of confidence to juſtification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds much more a precedence of particular aſſent, out of which, as out of a fountain, that affiance iſſueth: And howſoever it be true, that ſuch aſſent as is ſpoken of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſtrength from our affiance; yet from it, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then from other gifts of ſanctification; namely, as from evidences, and ſignes, and, as I may term them, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of our perſons, and diſpoſitions as it were, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105203:97"/>us to the Promiſes; or rather, to evidence the title we have (according to the Covenant) unto the merits, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument was, as I conceived it, on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; To faith juſtifying all men are bound: To particular perſwaſion, of Gods will to pardon ſins, all are not bound: For, God binds no man to believe an untruth: there are ſome of whom it never was, nor ſhall be true, that God will pardon their ſins as Reprobates: <hi>Ergó. Anſw.</hi>

                     <hi>Zanch. de natura Dei, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> That which is ground of his Argument I confeſs I find amongſt our Divines, more reſolutely determined, then diſtinctly explained: Their concluſion is, that all men, even Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, are bound to believe, that they are in Chriſt Elected to Salvation: Theſe reaſons ſeem to make againſt it: Firſt, for that there are, and ever have been many, to whom the name of Chriſt, or the benefits in him conveyed unto us, were never known: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſay of ſuch,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12.</note> as ſin without the Law, they ſhall periſh without the Law, By proportion we may ſay, They that ſin without the Goſpel, ſhall periſh without the Goſpel; The not giving credit thereto ſhall not be imputed to their condemnation, in as much as it was never revealed unto them: By conſequence therefore, there was no bond upon their conſcience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: Moreover, particular aſſent riſeth from that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Teſtimony of Gods ſpirit with ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Which who can ſay to be vouchſafed to Reprobates? But yield, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that Reprobates at leaſt in the Church are bound to believe it; What then? It follows thence, that God binds them to believe an untruth. <hi>Anſw.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in the thing, No untruth to them, except by their own default; becauſe, that howſoever God hath revealed that there are ſome Reprobates; Yet reveals he to no man, in this life, his own Reprobation: And as the rule of our actions is not Gods ſecret, but revealed will; ſo the rule, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith is not truth ſecretted, but truth revealed: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<note place="margin">Auguſt. Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid. ad Laurent.</note> 
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſticks not to ſay, that a man may will what is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105203:98"/>contrary to the will of God, He means his ſecret will, and yet in ſo willing Not ſinne. For Example, A child in the mortall diſeaſe of his father, may deſire the life of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſuch deſire the event proves contrary to the will of God; yet is no ſinne; becauſe Gods will revealed warrants ſuch deſire to us: Let us ſee, whether we may not find ſome ſemblance in the point of Believing: In <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.</note> the Lord ſends <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with that meſſage: <hi>Thou must die.</hi> An untruth in the event, and according to Gods ſecret purpoſe; yet can we doubt, but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> therein was bound to give credit to the Prophet? <hi>Similiter,</hi> To make full the anſwer: Thus let us conceive; Look as Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are propound to be believed of particulars; ſo, and no otherwiſe are we bound to believe them: how are they propounded? <hi>Hypothetically,</hi> rather, then <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorically;</hi> with limitation, rather then Abſolutely; For Example, How am I bound my ſinnes ſhall be forgiven? To wit, <hi>Hypothetically,</hi> If I believe in Chriſt, and repent my ſinnes: How to believe, I ſhall be ſaved? To wit, <hi>Hypothetically;</hi> if I keep preciſely the way that leadeth unto life: ſeparate the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> either in mine underſtanding, or practice, I am not bound to believe the Remiſſion of my ſinnes; nay, I am bound not to believe it: For, there is no mandate in the word, that tyes an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner, ſo continuing, to believe, that his ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; nay, there is ſomething equivalent to a mandate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, in ſuch caſe, to believe the contrary; inaſmuch as God hath revealed, that he will not be mercifull to ſuch an one, as goeth on ſtill in his wickedneſs. The ſumme is this; Reprobates are bound to particular faith <hi>Hypothetically;</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely they are not bound: ſhall we ſay now, their bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch belief binds them to believe an untruth? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs: For, it is true, of every particular, <hi>If he repent, His ſinnes ſhall be forgiven him:</hi> this is ever true, and thus onely are the promiſes propounded to faith of particulars: And it is never true, that God will pardon any mans ſinnes,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105203:98"/>except he repent, and believe the Goſpel: Thus farre by the way, in anſwer to theſe Arguments; rather wittily couched, then ſoundly concluding the purpoſe: Let us now return to the Apoſtle, and from him learn. 1. That Confidence in God for righteouſneſs through Chriſt, is neceſſary to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. 2. That juſtification belongs to all relying upon God in Chriſt for righteouſneſs: What ſhould I belong? it is the teſtimony of all the Prophets, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, that through his name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.41. and it is Chriſts own aſſertion: that, As, <hi>Whoſoever believeth on the ſonne of God hath everlaſting life:</hi> So, <hi>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not in him, ſhall never ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16, 18.36. <hi>Item,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. Where fitly falls in the queſtion, Whether any confidence may be placed in our works, or gifts of righteouſneſs, for juſtification and ſalvation? For better conceiving the truth in this kind, know we, that there is a main odds betwixt theſe two queſtions. 1. Whether our confidence, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled hope of ſalvation riſe from our works? and 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confidence may be placed in our works?</p>
               <p>The one for my part, I yield to them, in a ſenſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing my ſelf herein of <hi>Lumbards</hi> minde;

                  </note> that our hope ariſeth, partly, from precedent works, though the term of merit I abhor: Thus conceive it, In hope and confidence, we muſt conſider. 1. The habit, 2. The act, or exerciſe of it: The habit is meerly of Gods grace infuſed; the act ariſeth in part, from preſence and view of our obedience:

And <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> reaſon is not to be condemned; the obtaining of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, depends chiefly on Gods fidelity; but in part alſo on our works of obedience: therefore, as hope were not certain, if we ſhould do good works, and God were not faithfull; ſo neither can it be certain, if God be faithfull, and we neglect good works: And from this doctrine our beſt Divines are not abhorrent; all good works which are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105203:99"/>done in true faith,

                  </note> avail to confirm faith of the glory that ſhall be revealed; ſaith <hi>Zanchius, Non inficiamur, &amp;c.</hi> We deny not, but that by the gifts of God beſtowed on us, our hope of obtaining the good things to come, and of having eternall life, is confirmed: And it is a truth, that <hi>Thomas</hi> hath (his term being mollified) <hi>Spes dicitur ex operibus provenire, quantum ad ipſam rem exſpectatam:</hi> For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, from what evidence conclude we, that we ſhall be ſaved, but from our obedience? In all the diſcourſes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to confirm our aſſurance, whether of faith, or hope; ſee if the <hi>minor</hi> muſt not be framed, out of preſence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſs: For inſtance, How conclude I, that Chriſt is to me Author of ſalvation? The propoſition we have in <hi>Paul; Chriſt is Author of ſalvation to all that obey him. Heb.</hi> 5.9. The <hi>minor,</hi> my conſcience muſt yield me, I obey him, elſe, can I not rightly conclude, that to me Chriſt is author of ſalvation: <hi>Nullus recte ſperat beatitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem, niſi qui deo ſervivit, vel proponit deo ſervire,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bonaventure</hi> truely.</p>
               <p>The difficulty is onely, how our hope reſpects our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whether as a cauſe of ſalvation, or as an evidence, and ſigne onely of our having title to ſalvation.
<note place="margin">Lumbard qua ſupra.</note> Thus I think, we may truly reſolve; though obedience be a partiall cauſe of hope, as hath now been ſaid; yet it is an evidence, rather then, in property of ſpeech, a cauſe of ſalvation. And in that ſenſe, we may yield to <hi>Lumbard</hi> his deſcription of Hope, mitigating one term onely: Hope is a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of future bleſſedneſs, ariſing from Gods grace, and works precedent: and, <hi>ſine operibus bonis aliquid spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare non ſpes ſed praeſumptio dici poteſt.</hi>

               <p>The other queſtion nearly concerns the place; Whether confidence for ſalvation may be placed in our works? Here our Adverſaries thus mince it:

If they be true merits. 2. If it be done without pride, and with moderation: With ſuch impoſſible, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible Hypotheſes, what concluſion ſo abſurd, but may be holden for true? Yield we, that <hi>Adams</hi> fall hath not hurt his poſterity, by depraving nature, I would eaſily infer <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> his concluſion, That by the power of nature, it were poſſible to fulfill the Law. But, 1. The Hypotheſis is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable there being no true merits of any meer creature. 2. Yield there were ſome works of ſome men perfect; yet ſo will not the concluſion follow in reſpect of that frequent intervenience of ſins, deſtroying the value of other works; ſaith <hi>Hilary</hi> truly, <hi>Spes in miſericordia Dei in ſeculum,

To come briefly to the point, our concluſion is this; No confidence at all for righteouſneſs, or ſalvation ought to be placed in any our works, be they never ſo good, or ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect.</p>
               <p>Our firſt reaſon is, for that we find the moſt eminent amongſt Gods Saints renouncing all their own works, not onely naturall, but gracious alſo, and relying themſelves onely on Gods mercy in Chriſt; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. <hi>We do not preſent our ſupplications before thee, for our righteouſneſs, but for thy great mercies.</hi> Shall we ſay, as they, he ſpeaks as one conceiving it as a matter of beſt ſafety,

What then means that ſo plentifull, and humble confeſſion of ſins, in the former part of the prayer? In any reaſonable conſtruction, he ſpeaks as a man preſſed with conſcience of ſin ſo far, as that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth confuſion to be their onely due portion, if mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſuccour and relieve him not.</p>
               <p>To this we add theſe reaſons, weighty for the purpoſe, howſoever ſleightly paſſed over by Adverſaries; as, 1. That our beſt works are defiled by our concupiſcence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. 2. Are defective, and imperfect, according to the rule of the Law of God. 3. Loſe their worth, through interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the frequent intercurrence of ſins of ignorance, and weakneſs; would God not too often, by ſome falls almoſt preſumptuous.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Let us briefly view the reaſons they alledge for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They produce <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> praying remembrance of his good deeds, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Ezekias</hi> alſo alledging his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>David</hi> promiſing himſelf retribution (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe) he had kept Gods wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.20, 21. Many the like might have been heaped up: but how follows the concluſion? Therefore they put confidence in their works? Nay, ſee <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the ſame place, praying to be ſpared, according to the greatneſs of Gods mercy; think we he puts confidence in his works, as true (cauſes) of ſalvation, that prayes pardon of his imperfections? Thus briefly let us conceive, that the Saints of God alledging their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in prayers, reſpect not their works, as (matter) of their confidence; ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. but as inferiour helps of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105203:101"/>their hope, <hi>quatenus</hi> they are evidences of their being in the Covenant, and partakers of the promiſes. That they put confidence in, is Gods mercy, and truth in his promiſe; the reaſon of that confidence is their obedience, in reſpect of preſence, not of efficiency: Take one inftance for many, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.8. the ſervant of God prayes for reſtoring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of captivity; what layes he for ground of his prayer? The word that he ſpake by <hi>Moſes, If they turn unto me; I will gather them: Now Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nehemiah</hi>) <hi>we deſire to fear thy Name, therefore gather us.</hi> Can any think the holy man alledgeth their fear of God, as (matter) of confidence? See how diminutively he ſpeaks of it; it is rather a (deſire) to fear, then actuall fearing; and therefore needs mercy to accept it, hath no merit to procure ſo great a bleſſing from God.

And ſundry others, eminent in the Church of God, think it no hereſie to ſay; that our good works <hi>tincta ſanguine Chriſti,</hi> make us worthy of eternal life.

               <p>Others there are, that chooſe ſimply and without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to deny the aſſumption; leaſt peradventure the proud heart of man ſhould ſwell with opinion of its own confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing to its own ſalvation.

                  <hi>Who raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.]</hi> For the ſenſe of the words: It may be enquired, how the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt is aſcribed to the Father, whereas it is ſaid, <hi>The Sonne hath power to lay down his life, and to take it up again? Joh.</hi> 2.19. and 10.18. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer reſts in that old rule of <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> The externall works of the Trinity are undivided, in them all the whole three perſons work joyntly, in regard that the ſame divine virtue is equally reſiding in all. If it be yet demanded, why moſt uſually the reſurrection of Chriſt is aſſigned to the Father? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus we may conceive, that Chriſt in ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation emptyed himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. Not as loving his glory, but as forbearing for the time, the ordinary mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Divine power; inasmuch, that howſoever there was no work of the father, wherein he did not equally communicate, <hi>quod ad ſubſtantiam operis;</hi> yet ſo little ſhew thereof was there, in the infirmity of his fleſh, that they might ſeem to be wholly from the father, without any concurrence of Chriſt incarnate.</p>
               <p>Again, It may be demanded, What the reaſon is, that the Apoſtle ſingles out this effect of raiſing Chriſt from the dead, to deſcribe the father by? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some think, to maintain the proportion betwixt the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the faith of his ſeed; that as he reſpected the power of God raiſing the dead, in like ſort ſhould ours: This is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; but, if I be not deceived, there is ſome farther aym of the Apoſtle; he ſpeaks (methinks) as if he thought, there were ſome ſpeciall reaſon, and ground for confidence in God for juſtification, in this act of God raiſing Jeſus from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105203:102"/>the dead: And weigh it well, we ſhall finde, there is ſcace any thing more fit to ſtabliſh faith, in perſwaſion of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then this: For, when the Lord loſed the ſorrowes of death, and delivered our ſurety from bond age thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; doth he not give (evidence) that his juſtice is fully ſatisfied for our ſins, he fully reconciled unto us? Had not our ſurety Chriſt Jeſus, paid the utmoſt farthing due for our ſins, he had yet continued under the dominion of death, the wages of our ſins: Hence, ſaith <hi>Peter,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</note> that the Lord hath begotten us to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead;</hi> there being no greater, or more effectuall means to perſwade us, of pardon of ſins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, acceptation to life eternal; then that Chriſt our ſurety, and undertaker, is riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>There is a kinde of wiſdome, and prudence in believing; the Apoſtle ſeems here to give us an hint, for the nature and uſe of it; thus conceives it, It is, when a man fits the conſideration of the attributes and actions of God, to the particulars moſt neceſſary, and fit for faith to reſpect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeverall occaſions: as here, The Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing confidence in God for juſtification, fits us with a deſcription of him, by an action beſt available for confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in that reſpect to relye upon; namely, His raiſing of Jeſus from the dead: The like in ſundry other places, is obſervable. Would they humble themſelves for their ſins? they conſider God as terrible, and dreadfull in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: would they raiſe up themſelves with comfort? they conſider him as a God, that heepeth Covenant and promiſe <hi>as a father of mercies, and God of all conſolation:</hi> would they ſtabliſh hope, in expectation of things paſſing the courſe of nature? they conſider his endleſs power able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can aske, or think.</p>
               <p>There is a confuſed apprehenſion of the deity, for the moſt part liveleſs and ineffectuall; when men ingroſs only,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105203:103"/>and indiſtinctly mediate the Divine nature, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to particulars, concerning the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>And another as prepoſterous, unſeaſonable, and no leſs uncomfortable, when men fit their faith, with meditation of that, that is moſt unſeaſonable for their preſent ſtate: God is merciful, ſaith the preſumer; he is juſt, ſaith the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſtreſſed: Both true; he is juſt and mercifull, ſaith the Pſalmiſt; but ſhould not faith in wiſdome, contemplate what is fitteſt for the preſent neceſſity? This wiſdome pray we for.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing in this period remains; The Reaſon brought to aſſure us of like favour in like faith, for better confirming the comfort unto us.</p>
